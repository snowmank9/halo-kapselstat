1,TheLittleSongbird,4,Doesn't really enchant or entertain,"As 'Sleeping Beauty' is one of my favourite films, Disney, animated or otherwise, and Maleficent is a contender for the scariest and most memorable female villain of the Disney canon, despite the mixed reviews 'Maleficent' did maintain my interest. Finally watching it after being very behind with film-watching, 'Maleficent' does have enough to salvage it from being a complete waste but largely it is really underwhelming. The best thing about 'Maleficent' is the performance of Angelina Jolie. Jolie looks incredible in her knockout costume and make-up (which are spot on for the character), and she is sinister and alluring while also bringing some wit to some scenes. The film also looks gorgeous, it's beautifully shot with eye-catching and richly atmospheric set and costume design and the director's long-time experience in special effects work clearly shows in the film. The score is whimsical, haunting, hypnotic and beautifully orchestrated, as one would expect from James Newton Howard. In terms of story, the highlight is the suspenseful and quite powerful Christening scene, that gave the film and Maleficent's character so much promise and set the tone brilliantly. Also loved the delectably witty and subtly dangerous rapport between Maleficent and her servant Diaval, played creepily by Sam Riley, it is by far the best-executed and believable of all the character relationships in the film. However, part of the problem is that after how well Maleficent (film and character) is set up and after the character making such an impact as one of Disney's most iconic and scariest villains it just didn't seem believable no matter how much the film tried seeing her softened and more sympathetic. More problematic is that in the attempts to give Maleficent this dimension and origins story, most of the rest of the characters suffer, not just in being bland but in some cases being distorted. The worst case being King Stefan being made into a shockingly one-dimensional and underwritten villain. Prince Phillip is almost completely useless (Aurora's mother even more so), even for a plot device, and the three good fairies are irritating and their inept stupidity makes them far less endearing. With the performances, the only great one is Jolie's (Riley's is also effective but his role isn't anywhere near as juicy). Elle Fanning is a very vacuous and at worst somnambulist Aurora. Say what you will about the Aurora in the animated film being  dull catalyst in her film, she is at least one of the most beautiful visually Disney protagonists, radiates in charm and her singing voice is one of the most distinctive and loveliest in a Disney film ever, which at least makes her memorable, all three attributes of which Fanning lacks with her Aurora. Sharlto Copley both fails to engage and over-compensates as Stefan, Brenton Thwaites is bland while Juno Temple and fine actresses Lesley Manville and Imelda Staunton are charmless and annoying, their slapstick comic relief falling as flat as a pancake. Linda Woolverton's script is very lazy here, with clichéd and dreary dialogue and very clumsy attempts at being funny. Apart from the christening scene and the scenes between Maleficent and Diaval, the story is a mess of inconsistencies and half-baked ideas seen before in Disney films that executed them far better (notably 'Frozen'), not enough of it enchants and entertains and it is really hard to swallow Aurora being so forgiving as easily as that. Overall, starts off great and has benefits of looking beautiful, having a wonderfully composed music score and a lead performance that couldn't have been more perfect. But it isn't enchanting or entertaining enough really, and the way the other characters are written and the flawed execution of the script and story hurt 'Maleficent' severely. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
2,Leofwine_draca,3,Fairy tale reworking,"MALEFICENT is a fairy tale with a twist: it's a live-action follow-up to Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY, with the focus now on that film's villainous character, the witch Maleficent. It turns out that she's a misunderstood wood-dwelling recluse who's just looking for love, but with this film's laughable scripting you won't be buying that for a second. No, this version is a complete waste of time, and you realise that from the outset as it's one of those kid-friendly films absolutely loaded down with CGI: you get CGI flying through CGI landscapes, CGI castles, and CGI fairies and supporting characters. Shoehorned-in battle scenes are supposedly there to keep adults and boys involved but don't, while Angelina Jolie is merely distracting with those contact lenses and prosthetic cheekbones. The meandering storyline goes on and on without getting anywhere, and the unconvincing actors mired in this mess include a wasted Sharlto Copley and a miscast Sam Riley. The end result? Don't bother.",
3,mark.waltz,3,"Too beautiful to sleep through, but is it worthy of re-telling?","I was not initially impressed by the cover art of the poster and DVD of the 2014 blockbuster, a companion piece to the 1959 Disney classic ""Sleeping Beauty"". But upon seeing the film, I must say that it is much better looking than I anticipated, and Angelina Jolie doesn't look like someone renting a Kmart Halloween costume like the poster indicated it might look. Still, although you are pulled into the magical world of Disney through computer generated effects and obvious animation, is it really nothing more then assassination towards the 1959 classic? Or is it something that you can enjoy once, and then move on, hungry for more substance? I'm hoping that is a combination of the two, because as entertained as I was, I was really disappointed that it is all style and no substance, and certainly not something that is generally well-acted. In the case of this one, the acting ranks highly between over the top and severely bland. Then, there's the feminist aspect of the leading character which at times makes her totally unsympathetic.Malificient's backstory is presented believably with her a pretty young fairy, meeting an poor farm boy who through his own ambitions ends up becoming King, ultimately jilting her after cutting off her fairy wings which he uses to advance his position with the dying king, humiliated by Malificent in battle. His betrayal of the young Malificent leaves her filled with revenge, and that brings on the story of the curse to the spinning wheel and eventually her influence in the life of Princess Aurora. Jolie alternates between softly speaking and flailing curses, and if there ever was a bi-polar fairy in need of medication, Malificient is it. Even when she removes the curse after having an odd bond with the princess, it seems obvious that plans will change and that it is revenge that she is after. At times after the bonding occurs, the story takes more than passing resemblance to the fairy tale of Rapunzel which was then being finalized as part of the movie version of ""Into the Woods"". How teen-aged Aurora couldn't see that the darkly dressed Jolie was the evil fairy who cursed her makes no sense. I never quite believed that even after being introduced as a sweet young fairy that as older she was nothing more than an evil queen separated at birth from her twin who terrorized Snow White. The abundance of computer generated effects in movies may look great, but that doesn't mean that the films are. I am fairly happy to say that this one is adequate, no masterpiece but no stinker either. However, its anti-male mentality can be taxing, and trying to sanitize an obvious evil character just doesn't always jell. While the musical ""Wicked"" did make the Wicked Witch of the West understandable, this just makes Malificent seem like some sort of Satanic demon who only wants to castrate the one dimensional king who once gave her true love's kiss. The repeat of the original love song at the end has a demonic edge to it and left me spooked more than touched. Call this Disney's ""MacBeth-ish"" variation of the classic Grimm fairy tale.",

5,sddavis63,4,An Unnecessary Fairy Tale About A Fairy Tale,"Some years ago my daughter watcehd this movie and has always spoken of how good it was. I didn't watch it with her at the time but decided to check it out this morning with some free time that had fallen into my hands. I have to be honest and say that I was disappointed. Everything you would expect Disney to do right Disney did right. The CGI and the animation was quite good. The basic story was creative. The problem was that the story failed to pull me in. It's a fairy tale about a fairy tale. This is obviously based on ""Sleeping Beauty"" and seems to be trying to fill in the story of the evil fairy godmother who cast the spell on the Beauty. It explains what happened to Maleficent (the ""godmother"") and why she responded the way she did. Personally, I've never felt the need for backstories on the evil characters we sometimes come across. I think they're far more fun when they're just delightfully and wickedly evil. Telling us all about Maleficent's past was ike the movie version telling us why the Grinch was such a grinch. To me, it was unnecessary. Creative, yes. As I said - credit for that. But still unnecessary, for me at least. I have to confess that this was one of the few movies I've watched that I didn't make it through to the end with. After the first half hour or so my attention was wandering, and I actually turned it off with about 15 minutes to go. I wasn't even interested enough to see how it all turned out. (4/10)",
6,cricketbat,4,"Way to completely pull out the rug from yourselves, Disney.",,"Way to completely pull out the rug from yourselves, Disney. Maleficent changes everything we know and love about Sleeping Beauty for no good reason. This film isn't clever, it's subversive. Yes, it's visually appealing, but this movie dismisses classic fairytale elements and, instead, replaces them with modern reboot clichés. People who like this movie probably didn't ever like Sleeping Beauty in the first place."
7,pennyelenabooks,4,Good enough,"The classic story of Sleeping Beauty through the eyes of its villain, Maleficent. Maleficent is a beautiful fairy, living in a peaceful kingdom. She meats Stefan, a human boy who comes into her region to steal. They become friends, then lovers. But Stefan is too ambitious. He wants to become king, and in order for that to happen, he has to kill Maleficent, the protector of the magic kingdom. So he tricks her and cuts off her wings. Broken by Stefan's betrayal, Maleficent seeks revenge. And she gets it by coursing Stefan's only daughter, Aurora. The movie is not as good as I expected it to be. Yes, it is not the original story, but it is not as good either. I liked the fact that they showed Maleficent from the start and how she became who she became, but the whole battle theme, Aurora growing up, King Stefan turning mad, wasn't that interesting. And the meeting with prince Phillip, well, that was a disappointment. I liked, though, the special effects, the make up and the costumes. They were really good and looked quite original. But the plot doesn't really support their level, especially the ending that was eehh well, you could easily guess it from the beginning. So 4 out of 10,because I liked the performances for that I couldn't rate it lower.",
8,digitalbeachbum,1,Creative license can be bad,"The original story of Maleficent isn't anything to do with this movie. In fact, this entire movie is taking too much creative license. The story is good enough with out having to connect it to the original story of Sleeping Beauty. Aside from this, there are plenty of technical problems and mistakes in the story which are deus ex machina . Too many fallacious scenes. Overall a complete disappointment.",
9,TheMovieDiorama,4,"Maleficent malevolently rejuvenates a classic, whilst inducing you into an eternal coma.",,"Re-imagining a Disney classic by shifting the perspective of its story from the protagonist to the antagonist sounds like an act of courage. A valorous attempt to execute a refreshingly different approach. Whilst this is admirable, the antagonist themselves should not have their entire characterisation altered for the sake of emotional connectivity. It defeats the purpose of this exercise. With that said, despite Jolie's performance, superlative costume designs and Howard's reliable score as always, Maleficent never manages to soar through the clouds with her feathery wings. Instead, grounded by misdirection, characterised confusion and vacuous dialogue."
10,marmar-69780,4,maleficent,Its fells rushed at some moments and characters do some things that doesnt make sense for them to do but its has some good staff for kids,
11,Vartiainen,4,"Angelina Jolie is magnificent, but that's about it","I'm still not convinced that this movie needs to exist. It's a new take on the beloved Disney classic, which in turn is inspired by a tale of the same name by The Brothers Grimm. So yes, it's an adaptation based on an adaptation, but it's not really good or new enough to fully warrant its existence. That being said, it's not a bad film, actually, and I had fun watching it.The best thing about this film, by far, is the performance and sheer charisma of Angelina Jolie. She's the perfect fit for the role of Maleficent and in every scene you can see that she's having a blast with it. Pretty much the only scenes she doesn't absolutely sell are the ones where she has to be really loud and bombastic, but the rest are pure gold. The rest of the cast is good, though nothing special. Elle Fanning as Aurora is a fitting casting, though for a princess blessed with beauty beyond all measure she's perhaps a tad plain. But that's me nitpicking, and she's a pretty girl by any measure. Sharlto Copley is also a great deal of fun as King Stefan. Some people have complained that his accent is distracting, but I didn't really mind.The film also looks amazing. Some of the CGI looks a bit rubbery, especially in closeups, but most of it is very impressive and especially the backgrounds are breathtaking - fitting, because the original Sleeping Beauty by Disney was also known for its background art. Maleficent has its good sides. Jolie's performance is a joy to witness and the story, while a bit naivé and predictable, will keep you entertained. The characters aren't the film's strongest point, but none of them are offensively bad. It also looks great. Recommended if you're a fan of Jolie or are just looking for a good popcorn fairytale.",
12,freemantle_uk,3,An Underwhelming Fantasy Experience,"Dark version of popular fairy tales has become filmmaking idea, with films like Alice in Wonderland, Snow White and the Huntsman and Oz: The Great and Powerful being bit hits. Disney has now made a live-action version of Sleepy Beauty, focusing the villain Maleficent. Angelica Jolie takes on the title role: the producers begged her to play Maleficent and she was the best feature of this fantasy film. She gave a committed performance and was best at bringing out the fiery fury of Maleficent. The best scene in the film was the Christening scene when Maleficent wants revenges against the main that betrayed her and King Stefan (played by District 9's Sharlto Copley) begging her not to curse his new born daughter, giving his character some depth. Robert Stromberg, the production designer of films likes Avatar and Oz and the Great and Powerful makes his directional debut and it shows. The costumes, particularly of the army and the castle set design is excellent and Oscar worthy, but the CGI is sub-par for a big budget fantasy film and the creature designs were downright terrible. Stromberg and writer Linda Woolverton were taking an approach of being a dark fantasy and mixing in annoying comedy shtick by the three pixies who are totally hopeless. The action was solid enough but it affected by a strange zoom effect which annoying and out of place. Maleficent was an underwhelming experience that wasted potential with an under written plot and characters and poor direction. A real disappointment.",
13,strong-122-478885,3,"Oh! No! Not Another Stupid New Twist On ""True Love's"" Kiss!??",,"You know, when our treacherous lover-boy, Stephan cut off Maleficent's massive wings (which was certainly no small undertaking), I sure wish that he had also hacked off those damn annoying antlers... I mean, horns of hers, as well. Those 2 blasted things protruding out of her head really began to bug me, big-time."
14,jadepietro,3,Witchy Woman,This film is not recommended. Maleficent is an act of malfeasance that creates much injury to the good memory of the Charles Perrault folk tale. The film is waste of your time and the artisans involved. The only happily-ever-after feeling I had was exiting the theater. GRADE: C-,
15,MartianOctocretr5,4,Lots of noise; unimpressive take on this old story,"Special effects are impressive, but always overdone. Every battle looks like something George Lucas and Michael Bay came up with when they got drunk together one night. Acting is poor throughout, and the director's heavy-handed approach is loud but never interesting. This movie tries hard to impress you with smoke and mirrors, but does not succeed.",
16,michaeltrivedi,3,Fun Watch Actually,"Maleficent was a fun watch surprisingly. I actually worked at Paramount Studios at the time, and got to watch it on their special movie theater screen on the lot. It was actually quite a spooky film, but made for kids which was nice. I would recommend a quick viewing if it's on some random night. The effects are pretty cool.",
17,thekarmicnomad,3,Very pretty but oh so stupid.,"This is an attempt at giving Sleeping Beauty the 'Wicked' treatment. Tries, and fails dismally. Small children will be entertained by the graphics, adults will be dumb founded by the unnecessary moronic story. I was left wondering - given the 'true' turn of events - who is propagating the version of Sleeping Beauty we all know anyway?",
18,RforFilm,4,A good performance and some nice imagery can't save Maleficent from a poor script and unconvincing CGI,"Taking the eye candy CGI out of the picture, how's the full story? Though it's not the worst, this is just a bland fairy tale that's meant for children only (or those just looking for a fairy tale), giving pretty imagery and uninteresting characters. Why couldn't Maleficent had focused on the political aspects of the fairy and human kingdoms. Had it gone with that route, we might have gotten material that rivals Game of Thrones. But as it is, this is a popcorn fantasy only for those that aren't looking for anything meaty. I'll give this two Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty out of five. It didn't do me any bit except for some nice imagery, but I'm sure there is a large audience that will make this a hit. I'll stick with Sleeping Beauty myself, thank you.",
19,jessegehrig,2,"Rub one out the right way, use your hands","The purpose of writing, specifically when it concerns a movie's screenplay, is to tell a story through characters, dialog and setting. This movie started out with one screenplay but ended production with another screenplay--that or Maleficent's screenplay was doomed from the start. This is Angelina Jolie masturbating to herself for like two hours, but not in a good way like say for instance two hours of watching Angelina rub one out, it's two hours of Angelina masturbating to herself using sets, and CGI, and costumes, and actors, and a film director, and a screenwriter, and a production company, and a movie studio, instead of just using the fingers God gave her.",
20,DarthVoorhees,4,"The worst kind of Disney film, the kind that condescendingly talks down to kids",It's truly a shame 'Maleficent' is a failure because stories like this are beneficial to children. I like the idea of these supposed warped fairy tales because they show kids that labels are harmful and to look for the positive qualities in all people. 'Maleficent' is more like the harmful Disney tales of past which perpetuate negative world views through easy thematic choices and images of over theatrical beautiful people and ugly villains. 'Maleficent' needed to not necessarily go darker but deeper and find a dramatic arc in the title character. It's really just Angelina Jolie playing fairy tale dress up with action sequences stolen verbatim from better fantasy films.,
21,mahmus,4,A bad movie with some things going for it,"Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning do their best, but this is just an unnecessary and at times insulting reimagining of the original classic.",
22,SquigglyCrunch,3,A Bad Spin-Off That Tries to Humanize a Villain Without Giving them any Developmental Scenes,"Maleficent is a spin-off of the Disney classic 'Sleeping Beauty'. It follows the main villain in an attempt to modernize the entire story. The main goal of the movie appeared to be to humanize the villain, Maleficent. However, the best time to humanize this character was right at the beginning, and it's idea of 'trying' was narrating a generic back story for the character without giving her any dialogue or lines or anything that would make the audience relate to her. The narrator simply told us her characteristics, and that was that. Nobody hears a narrator say ""She was kind"" and thinks ""Oh yeah, I relate to that"". You have to see that kindness on screen the fully understand and relate to it, and there was none of that. So that didn't work, but maybe the rest of the movie is good, after all it is Sleeping Beauty. Other than the rest of the characters, all of whom are bland and uninteresting, the acting was sub-par at best. They were completely over-acted which, again, makes it hard to relate to the characters. The special effects were on and off. Sometimes they were good, sometimes they were terrible, mostly being the latter. And in a movie all about fantasy and magic and basically revolving around CGI, that isn't really a good thing. One thing that I got a kick out of though were the action scenes. They were terrible, mind you, but they were terrible in a funny way. In every single action scene the camera would focus on a character, then quickly zoom in on their face after a moment of hesitation, and it was hilarious. It was like this were a video game where the player was looking for something and they suddenly spotted it, at which point their vision zooms in to get a better idea of what they're looking at. Maybe that doesn't make sense, but you'll know it when you see it. It's so bad, yet it's so funny. Overall Maleficent just sucks. It's just a bad movie. It's kind of funny, but for all the wrong reasons. The characters are so bland robots could've played them and nothing would've changed. The CGI is usually bad, the humanizing attempt was both clear and bad, and the action was downright awful. In the end I suggest you leave this one on the shelf, whatever shelf that may be, and watch something else.",
23,sbweightman,3,Mediocre rather than special,"Mediocre rather than special - this is still a very twee interpretation of the story which skips along at a fair pace and leaves a lot of the characters underdeveloped. Top special effects, but the acting is unremarkable and the film seems to focus on style rather than substance.",
24,TheSquiss,4,"Dull, twee fairy tale adaptation saved only by production design & Jolie's sexy, withering villainess.","Think you know the story of Sleeping Beauty? Think again. At least, that's the intention of Robert Stromberg's directorial debut, Maleficent.

The double Oscar-wining production designer (of Avatar and Alice in Wonderland) cherry-picks from Charles Perrault's original story, La Belle au Bois Dormant, and Disney's subsequent bastardization, gives a backstory to the malignant fairy that cursed the newborn Princess Aurora and then changes Well, you'll just have to see for yourself.

Stromberg's intention is good, the production design is mostly superb and he's landed himself a fantastic leading lady in Angelina Jolie as the deliciously evil Maleficent. Top marks so far. The second official trailer (ignore the third, 'let's show everything' trailer) enticed me so much that I overturned my initial reticence and took a punt. The use of Lana Del Rey's reimagining of Once Upon A Dream from the 1959 Disney film as the trailer's score is wonderfully haunting and chills the spine. So why is it squandered on the final credits of the full film when 98% of the audience has departed with joy in their hearts?

And so it is with Maleficent.

It begins with an unforgivable and horrendous narration that goes on and on patronizingly, annoyingly, endlessly and is then relied upon frequently when Stromberg has run out of ideas to tell his story. Not even the talent of Janet McTeer can make the narration palatable. If boredom set in early, relief when actors upon the screen took up the story was short-lived. How, with a budget on this scale (about $180m) is it not possible to find two child actors to play the young Maleficent and Stefan who can actually act?

And the poor performances don't stop with the children, although to be fair to Elle Fanning, a more than capable actress, one of the gifts bestowed upon her Aurora at birth is perpetual happiness even in the face of adversity. What a pity Stromberg directs her to grin inanely at everything around her. The effect is not the beautiful, heartwarming child we should all fall for and want to protect but a horribly, painfully, artificially happy moron for whom a curse-induced coma cannot arrive quickly enough.

As for Brenton Thwaites (Prince Philip, the Prince Charming character), his performance is so shockingly stilted he appears to have an entire tribe of broomsticks bound together and rammed up his ass.

Sharlto Copley plays Aurora's father, King Stefan, with a certain melodramatic flare, but we've to come expect that from him and it works perfectly here. It also serves to differ his reign from that of the former monarch, King Henry, played with panache by British stalwart Kenneth Cranham.

There is light relief from the trio of fairies (Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville and Juno Temple) but the occasional, weak attempt at slapstick that usually involves them only serves to diminish the impact that Maleficent should have.

The sets are beautiful and the effects mostly spectacular, bar the occasional oversight like the wolf, which is clunky enough to be the brother of Harry Potter's, Fluffy. The walls that clatter apart in Maleficent's wake are fantastic, and the incidental fauna and flora are reminiscent of all that was good about Avatar and, to a certain degree, Oz the Great and Powerful, another of Stromberg's production design triumphs.

Principally, Stromberg has failed on two counts: 1. He hasn't realized that great children's films (and books) enthrall adults just as much, on their own level and 2. He fails to enthrall the children. Stromberg does; not Angelina Jolie.

And so, along with the production design, we come to the reason Maleficent earns four stars instead of just one: Angelina Jolie.

But for Jolie Maleficent would be a tedious, dull, twee and horrible experience. Like Charlize Theron in Snow White and the Huntsman, she inhabits her villainess with a cold, vicious, prickly evil that is sexy, sassy and exciting. With a cold, crisp English accent, she frosts the atmosphere and crushes her opponents with a withering stare before unleashing her magical fury. Frequently Stromberg cuts to an ECU of her eyes, beautifully lit to accentuate her fantastically sharpened cheekbones and concentrate the power of her eyes. It is here that Stromberg succeeds. And it is Angeline Jolie who saves him.

If I should ever suffer death by fairytale, please don't let it be from boredom caused by an inept director; let it be at the hand of the Angelina Jolie's Maleficent.",
25,judywalker2,4,Big miss for Disney,"This movie was a big miss for Disney and I'm really shocked after how well they did with Frozen. I heard this movie had its problems but I never expected something so boring. Yes Jolie looks great in the makeup for the older Maleficient but her standing there with big gigantic wings (when I saw them in the trailers I knew the movie was in trouble) she looked really stupid. The other fairies, well they look like fairies. Now they act like the three Stooges but at least they look like fairies; she looked like a vampire from Underworld. The actor who played King Stephon was terrible, every time I heard his voice I just wanted to cringe. The story lacked imagination the ending was just dumb. Snow White and the Huntsman and this movie both have the same problem; one great actor/actress and no plot. Too bad.",
26,ArchonCinemaReviews,2,Sloppy plot produces flimsy fairy tale,"Maleficent attempts to tell an old story anew but all it does is completely redefine the title character's personality without taking the time to create a feasible explanation and alternative to the well known fairytale.

In Disney's new Maleficent we first see Maleficent as a young girl with magnificent wings. She is the largest fairy and protector of the magical Moors from the greedy humans in another nearby kingdom. She meets a human Stefan who befriends her and she eventually falls in love with him only to be betrayed by his selfish and sinful human-nature.

This is the new and unknown back-story that motivates the Maleficent we know from the animated Disney narrative.

Children will enjoy this movie. It is beautifully designed and full of wonderful scenery with magical creatures and talking trees! Disney plays into the innocence of children and fascination they have for nature and capitalize on it. There is the darkness of a discernible villain and the light of a righteous hero.

Adults and fans of the fairy tale will be disappointed. The film is drawn out because no story progresses nor evolution occurs within Maleficent. The plot is flimsy, weak and completely inconsistent with the narrative and poorly conceptualized. Nothing makes any sense and the title character's behavior is neither explained with a back-story nor revealed as a sad misunderstanding.

The writers try to make you believe that Maleficent endured the ultimate betrayal, and by her closest most trusted loved one. There is absolutely no proof of this with the exception of a fabulously believable freak out by Angelina Jolie when she awakens to find herself mutilated. No wonderful love story involving the future king Stefan is shown and the first five minutes should only exist on the editing room floor.

There is a nice sentiment behind the maker's intentions but the entire story is unrefined, like a first draft. Director Robert Stromberg is new and it shows. He lacks the confidence, ability and experience to take the initiative and lead the story. The writer, Linda Woolverton, is most at fault in her creation of a feeble, unconvincing and baseless story.

Executives should have used some of their $180million dollar budget on consulting with Gregory Maguire. Then there would be an intelligent, logical but beautiful plot and Woolverton could do what she does best, create a screenplay to match.

Now for the worst party of the film, the fairy god mothers. Oh dear lord, what have they done to the fairy godmothers? They are flighty, imbecilic, self-absorbed, twits! Since the story is so moronic the fairy involvement in raising Aurora is explained with an impractical sentence, as is most of the film. Then they spend the whole 16 years they are supposedly watching Aurora by complaining about its inconvenience and arguing like the three stooges.

Elle Fanning is not the enchanting Aurora and her Aurora is annoyingly cloying. They try to make it seem like this profound love exists for Aurora from Maleficent.

Angelina Jolie looks like Maleficent. She has the stature, the prowess, the harsh beauty and the outfit but little else. Sadly she never really acts and her accent is slacking, she just stands and glares; I never sense malice, anger, love, betrayal, or anything for that matter and certainly not ominous villainous evil. I am supposed to believe she has a quiet strength from her power? No.

I'm guessing Stromberg was taken by her beauty and celebrity, and thought that sufficient.

With a flimsy story, bad acting and a complete disregard for the story's structure, the whole thing is preposterous. Is creating a harmonious rational account where a fairy turns evil really that difficult? Or did executives hope that nobody would notice behind the cloak of the Disney/Jolie name.

I never felt anything watching this movie, especially considering the immense power a Disney movie can have. Nope, no hope, no love, no care, no warmth – I honestly never felt a single emotion for the whole shebang except for when the credits rolled.",
27,daisukereds,1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"I'm surprised at how ANYONE could take a simple fairy tale movie from 1959 and ruin the story so badly. Watched them back-to-back. It's fine when someone wants to take something and make a different take of it. But what is the point of this? Ruin all characters, even Maleficent herself?? The fairies are not caring, but hateful and dumb! The prince is useless and their meeting lacks any emotion.. Originally, their meeting in the forest by singing as if a dream come true is one of the best scenes of the original. In a few lines you understand her frustration, and the prince's awe at her beauty! Also, the prince Philip is at the end for some reason. He ""felt"" he needed to be there, but does nothing, and the feelings between them don't exist.

The King trusts 3 fairies he has never seen with his newborn daughter for 16 years! He even calls them idiots when Aurora is back. Granted, this version of the King is an idiot himself in every level. A man that found love at a young age, but for NO reason (aside from being ""a man"", whom are ALL greedy by nature, according to this) left because he wanted more, even though he never had anything and should've had it all in Maleficent.

Compared to the original, there are more scenes of unknown men being trashed around by CGI than real characters and real plot.

The great feeling I had after the original was washed away by the disgust caused by this unnecessary piece of Garbage!!",
28,TheMarwood,4,Generic and dull Disney fare,"This charmless fairytale is a brisk 88 minutes (9 minutes of end credits bring this to 97 minutes) and it's played so safe and rendered so generic and accessible, that it feels like a product more than a film.

With first time director Robert Stromberg's background in visual effects and digital production design, he seems ill equipped to flesh out the narrative and get consistent performances from his cast. Were the actors even directed? They all seem left to their own devices - Jolie is genuinely creepy in some scenes, hammy in others, sometimes just posing for the camera and occasionally lost in front of a green screen. Sharlto Copley over acts. The three fairies are grating. Elle Fanning has a nice smile plastered to her face, but the script requires little else from her.

The vfx are a mixed bag, as the environment work is mostly well done, but some creature work is shoddy, the fairies are terrible and a few shots of an entirely CG Jolie in action is lazy and cheap looking.

Maleficent just coasts by on the established mythology of the title character and is a hack job of connect the dots poor writing, uneven acting, no vision from the first time director and manages to bore even at its abbreviated length.",
29,bob_bear,1,In a word...crap!,"Well, that's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Angelina Jolie does her best impression of sucking a lemon as she wanders aimlessly through a plot written on the back of a fag packet. The End.

Absolutely no explanation as to why King Stefan betrayed his childhood sweetheart. For the crown? Just like a man then...er NOT!

Utterly built around the lead actress. No one else to compete. And she's not all that. Not even close.

30,deacon_blues-3,4,"One prolonged, mammoth fit of PMS!","They should have entitled this film ""Revenge of the PC PMS."" It was not enough for the scriptwriters to butcher the original fairy tale into something foreign and unrecognizable, but they also displayed the unmitigated hubris to offer this version as the ""real story!"" What a load!

This film is moronic from the start, applying the undeniably evil name ""Maleficent"" to the original fairy character before she had even done anything wicked. This is a puzzle whose only answer is either ignorance or a lack of attention to detail. The name ""Maleficent"" is clearly a character description of someone who is both malicious and magnificently powerful. But I suppose such a level of understanding was considered beyond the intelligence of the target audience for this film.

Set aside the whole tired and annoying insistence on an earth-spirit, new-age reinterpretation of everything from the original classic story, this Maleficent is a loving innocent little fairy (although she has decidedly demonic horns and bat-like horned wings!) who is jilted by some little jerk named Stephen whom she meets first as a jewel thief. Surprise! The little bandit leads her on and eventually amputates her wings to impress the human king, thus securing the throne for himself. Rather than realize that he was not worth all the trouble anyway and getting on with her life, Maleficent goes into a prolonged hissy-fit and becomes bent on making everyone else as miserable as she is. Why she did not merely use her obviously prodigious magical powers (turning a crow into a man, a wolf, a horse, and finally a dragon, plus growing a giant wall of brambles (to protect her territory, not to keep the hero prince out of the castle where the beauty sleeps, as in the original) to just give herself a new pair of wings and move on with her life, I cannot begin to fathom.

Also, someone should have told the scriptwriters that iron is a common, naturally occurring element that Maleficent would have unavoidably encountered constantly in her own realm. Instead, we have this nonsensically applied ""iron allergy"" throughout the film whenever the writers' whim finds it useful to their tortured excuse for a story. Obviously this is intended as a metaphor for the evil of human weapons and warfare, which of course is so foreign to the pure, gentle, loving nature spirits. Another load of PC environmentalist nonsense.

Another inconsistency is that, as in the original, the third pixie is interrupted before she is able to bestow her blessing upon the newborn princess. In the classic film, this becomes the saving grace of the story, allowing the third pixie give her the hope of being awakened by the kiss of a hero prince. But in this tortured, convoluted version, the third blessing just goes undone, which makes no sense. Why interrupt the third pixie if you're not going to use it as an essential element to drive the story? This is just poor storytelling, period.

Then we have the silly, interminably drawn-out narrative of how the conflicted sorceress enters into a prolonged love-hate relationship with the princess. Maleficent ends up doing all the providing and protecting that the inept trio of pixies are seemingly incapable of. In the crucial ""true love's kiss"" scene, the handsome prince is useless, and it is Maleficent herself who delivers the needed wakeup call. I half expected the soundtrack to break out into a chorus of ""I Kissed a Girl"" in glorious lesbian triumph!

On another subject, one of the possible reasons that Maleficent did not just grow a new pair of wings is that her emotional anguish was not about losing her wings, but her broken heart. So far, so good; but in the final act of the film, it suddenly becomes all about the lost wings! Why the wings didn't just reattach themselves right after Stephen removed them is never explained. I guess such a question never occurred to the writers.

The fact is that this entire butchery of a story is just a prolonged piece of feminist propaganda, much like the equally twisted ""Frozen"" of recent release. All the male characters are useless at best, and otherwise selfishly and insensitively evil on average. The rampant egotism of our modern culture is obsessed with revising and reinterpreting everything in its own image and according to its own PC understanding. Thus it can learn nothing from the past and is likely to be doomed to eventually repeat all the most foolish and fatal of its mistakes.

Leave it to our current self-aggrandizing culture to take a lovely classic tale full of precious moral values and transform it into this narcissistic mess of politically correct, morally ambivalent silliness.

I cannot imagine Walt himself having anything to do with this mutilated version of his classic original. But then so much of what has come out lately is aimed merely at the politically correct, airhead segment of of society. Not worthy of serious consideration.

Spectacular FX, BTW; but that does not make up for a rotten, worthless story.",

32,robert3750,1,Trashes the morality of the classic fairy tale,"It's unfortunate that Disney has mutated into an advocate for a particular brand of modern feminism. In the name of that advocacy, they decide that they have no use for conventional morality. ""Maleficent isn't really evil, she's actually a shining example of feminine empowerment, and she only did bad things because of the evil actions of MEN"". Revolting.",
33,YJLcool,4,Maleficent is a bit of a mixed bag...,"In all honesty, Maleficent is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a refreshing and engaging take on a much beloved Disney classic that's full of twists and turns. But sadly, it seems that Disney has re-imagined the 1959 Sleeping Beauty to a whole new level with Maleficent to the point, dare I say, butchered the beloved 1959 classic that most of us hold dear.

Despite the similarities...the protruding cheekbones, huge demonic- looking horns, fiery red lips, black cloak and dress, The Mistress of All Evil is vastly different from the original version of her in Sleeping Beauty. In this film, Maleficent is portrayed as a good fairy who rules and protects the Moors, a magical kingdom close to the human kingdom. But she was betrayed and soon she was motivated by hatred, anger and revenge that she placed the curse on Aurora. As years passed by, Maleficent eventually grew to love and care for her that she regretted her actions and tried to undo her curse but she couldn't as the curse is irreversible.

The Mistress of All Evil supposed to be a cruel and wicked character, but this film ultimately portrayed her as a 'less evil', misunderstood, more heartfelt and humane character. Aside from that, the thoughts and motivation of other supporting characters (especially the king) and the ending diverts so far from the original source material that it feels like a totally different film. At the same time, because of this diversion, the story becomes rather unpredictable, which is quite exciting (you think you know the story and how it goes later on, but it's not). Because the focus of the film is Maleficent and her relationship with Aurora, the relationship between the three fairies (Flittle, Knotgrass and Thistletwit) and Aurora is underdeveloped and never touched on throughout the film.

The film is also full of fantastical scenes and mystical creatures, which should be a visual delight for kids. Another worthy mention is that Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast in the lead role. She embodies the character and makes it her own. She managed to show the different emotional stages of her character vividly. I firmly believe that no other actresses could actually replace her as the character.

In many ways, Maleficent exceeded my expectations that I never know I had. Rarely it hurts me to give a low rating not because of poor acting, bad CGI or horrible storytelling, but due to a script that disrespects its source material and an ending that's similar to last year's Disney release. I wished that the story could be more in tune with the original. Why Disney? Why? Why you're doing this?

35,pefrss,2,The kind and caring evil Angelina Jolie in a boring Disney movie,"Summer is here and there is even less in the movie theaters for me to see. Well, I guess that I am not the target audience for Malificent, but I love fairy tales , even at my age. I have to admit that I had never heard of Malificent. I grew up with Little Briar Rose from the Brothers Grimm and in this tale there are thirteen wise women who come to the baptism of the young princess to bestow their gifts on her. The problem in that story was that the King had only twelve golden plates and so he did not invite wise woman no. 13, who showed up anyway and cursed the child and the whole kingdom to fall in a hundred years sleep, once the girl pricked her finger on a spindle. So I was curious to see what evil fairy Angelina Jolie was playing. There was not much evil going on at the beginning of the film and I found it quite boring. I did not think that the visual were so impressive and once the character of Angelina Jolie turned ""evil"" she looked deformed and I spent most of my time wondering how they achieved that very unnatural look. I read reviews before seeing the movie and nearly everybody praised Angelina Jolie and her performance. But I have to say I was only confused. I thought she was supposed to be evil and there was really nothing evil about her. She was angry sometimes, but most of the times she was kind and caring.

Now I have to admit that I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie, the person. Everything I read about her, I like. She seems to be intelligent, a good business woman, handles the media very well and does a lot of good things around the world. I even liked her wild youth. But I have yet to see a movie with her which really convinces me.

That said, she is the best part of that movie. The rest of it is completely forgettable. And the worst is that the movie is boring. I was not impressed by any of the special effects or fairy characters or any of the other visuals. I caught myself looking at my watch all the time and this movie is only 97 minutes long, but it feels like it is going on forever.",
36,wpirotte,4,Disney makes friends with Satan,"Production / Acting / Direction / Writing 10/10 Morality play value 1/10 Yet another insidious effort by the Hollywood Left, now merely one among several movies, series, etc, to convince our most impressionable citizens that good is not really good at all, evil is actually quite good, and getting along is well, shucks, the only thing that matters. From the overriding theme of white oppression to the ultimate revelation that these satanic creatures are merely trying to defend themselves, few stones are left unturned. We even get a few touches of tree hugging, literally, especially when the giant tree is beating up ""evil white lady"" at the end. Cleverly packaged as yet ANOTHER re-imagining of an old story (big sigh), the appeal to adults is obviously infectious. What possible harm could come from letting our babies get exposed to alternative interpretations of traditional stories? ""Jesus is just all right with me"" has been replaced with ""Lucifer's ma homey"" And Europe/America, is, indeed, the less for it. The Bell tolls for thee.",

Angelina Jolie was better in ""Changeling"", a much more believable and Oscar-worthy role. Several of the actors did a bad job. The guy playing the king was especially horrible. Elle Fanning was annoying with her wide-rimmed smile. They turned the three fairies everyone loved into completely hideous idiots bordering on child abuse. Almost all the characters were one-dimensional, and uninteresting. And how was it that Aurora didn't cry when her father died? Why didn't anyone see the one of the ""magical trees"" at the beginning of the film totally resemble the Balrog from ""Fellowship of the Ring""!!??? Ugh...

39,CinemaCocoa,3,Disney DESTROYS one of the iconic greats in villainy!,"Is there any better example of missing the point than this? Maleficent: ""I am the Queen of All Evil"" - Sleeping Beauty 1959. Now, Maleficent is a Paragon of True Love.

When the realm of fairies and the world of humans fall into war, Maleficent, one of the most powerful of fairies, strives to protect her lands. Her childhood love for Prince Stephen is betrayed when he rises to power, and in a fit of rage she curses his newborn child Aurora to die before her sixteenth birthday. However as Aurora grows up in seclusion Maleficent questions her own actions... while King Stephen becomes wrathful.

This film is blasphemous to the titular character. My childhood felt butchered by the film's end.

First, you must appreciate how hard it is for me to say that... I went into this film with only quiet scepticism and I had done away with my doubts. But Sleeping Beauty is my favourite Disney film. Why? Not for the archetypal characters or accident prone fairies, no, for Maleficent herself. Sure, she has no motive and is simply an antagonist. But she is one of the greats in film villainy: terrible, wrathful and cruel, giving some of animation's most haunting moments in the process.

2014's Maleficent begins with a rosy-cheeked, innocent little fairy girl Maleficent.

Okay, okay, I can restrain myself... This is partly expected from today's Disney and I stomached Boba Fett being a kid didn't I? (not really) Everything will go wrong and the true Maleficent will bloom before my eyes! Nope.

This film's brazenly confident narration tells me: ""So you think you know the tale?"" Well yes, in fact I do; it is my favourite tale. Well, turns out I don't know it at all when they make stuff up! Maleficent does not follow 1959 Sleeping Beauty's foundation at all. I don't know the fairytale you say, Disney? Let's see... How about I research the Sleeping Beauty tale just now... maybe Maleficent is telling the true tale, maybe I've gravely misjudged the source material. Nope. Turns out nothing in this film is from the source material! The 1959 animation has far, far more references to the original tale (and I am taking into account the multiple renditions of the fairytale) Come on, Disney! Don't you dare rewrite your history and proclaim it is wrong. Don't you dare assume to teach the true fairytale if you have no desire to even come close to it! Most of all, don't you dare make a film about a villain if you have no intention of going through with it!

This film is about Maleficent (a fabrication of Disney, incidentally) but while we get a character who looks and sounds like her, she is acting out being a misunderstood, repressed fairy, fighting an evil King. How, I am desperate to know, can Disney take their most EVIL character and make her a noble, tragic soul that I should feel sympathy for?? Why has Disney taken their own creation, after decades of cementing her place as a grand villain, and turned her into a heroine?

God, this film... It could have been good, no it could have been glorious, if it had simply kept the character unchanged. It boggles my mind why they did it. Angelina Jolie is exceptional, I love her as an actress and she is the perfect fit for Maleficent. The special effects are good and there's heaps of atmosphere, her ent-like tree soldiers are awesome as well. The three fairies weren't bad either (apart from being given the wrong names!) they were always ditsy, and King Stephen's fear and paranoia was great, it was an actual improvement on the 1959 animation; a father would be consumed with guilt and fear in those circumstances.

But damn did they screw.up.everything.else. By the halfway mark I was bored, and by the end I had ceased caring. What a tragic waste of Jolie's perfect talents. I would not be surprised if Walt Disney himself is turning in his grave.

This is simply a creative decision, probably by committee, that I absolutely cannot understand.",
40,CalvinValjean,4,Eventually the Spell Wears Off...,"This is one of the few examples of a film that I've really gone back on and changed my mind about. I don't usually pull a complete 180 on my opinion of a film, but this one did it.

I love Disney's original SLEEPING BEAUTY from 1959; one of the studio's most gorgeous- looking films with a hypnotic, poetic quality, and a strong villain. When I saw MALEFICENT for the first time, I fell for its spell. I liked that here was a live-action fairy tale movie that WASN'T about big CGI-battles (there's only one small battle at the very beginning). Here was a movie that showed the dark side of fairy tales (even having a subtextual date-rape scene) with a slower pace, more visual-oriented storytelling, and had a Feminist message. Plus I liked Angelina Jolie and her dynamic with her servant Diaval (Sam Riley). I even bought the Blu-Ray.

But with each repeat viewing I began to find more flaws in the film. One is the complete destruction of the characters of the three fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merriweather (they change the names to Flittle, Knotgrass, and Thistletwit for some reason, but whatever. It's basically those characters). They are turned into complete idiots. The Nostalgia Critic actually worded it best: it feels as if the screenwriter of this film had a personal vendetta against the creator of those characters. I can understand that in order to make Maleficent seem like the heroine of the story, the movie has to downplay these fairies, but it's pushed much too far. They come off grotesquely stupid and incapable of raising a child. We see almost no interaction between them and Aurora.

Speaking of Aurora, Elle Fanning is horribly bland. This is supposed to be the most beautiful princess to ever live, and she offers little in terms of character or personality. Believe it or not, the animated version of the character actually had more screen presence with her ethereal singing voice. Another problem with the story is the pace: there is a 16-year gap in the story where nothing happens. The entire middle act of the film is just Maleficent watching Aurora grow, the two bond, and 16 years pass within the story with little conflict. The film tries hard to compensate for this lack of progression by inserting lots of filler of King Stefan going mad. Even at a mere 88-minute runtime, the film seems dragged out. It's really hard to make a story compelling when the plot literally has to stop and not move forward for 16 years until it can progress.

Prince Philip is truly given nothing to do. The movie is trying to go for the same message as FROZEN; the ""true love"" of the story is between two women (in this case a mother and daughter-figure) instead of romance. But while I can appreciate this modern take on the fairy tale narrative, it's just so sloppily done to the point that Philip is a non-character who gets kicked out of the movie. When he shows up again at the very end, it feels like a tacked-on ""Oh yeah, we forgot about him"" moment. FROZEN was much smarter in its subversive take on the genre.

The 1959 animated film is not intended to be realistic. It embraces the fact that it's a fairy tale and has all the Hollywood and Disney archetypes of the 1950's. Sure, it wasn't big on character development, but it had some nice magical moments. You could enjoy the whimsy of Aurora and Philip meeting and falling in love, the humor of the three fairies, and the menace of Maleficent. It was a pure fairy tale.

But this film, made for a 2014 audience, is slightly harder to pigeon-hole. It's not quite sure if it wants to be a pure fairy tale that throws logic completely to the wind or if it wants to be a more adult, gritty, realistic, and sophisticated take on the story. Once you look beyond the performances of Jolie and Riley, the only two actors in the movie who are actually engaging, you're left with a pretty meh story.

By the third time I saw the film, my problems with it were so large that I realized I would probably not be likely to watch it again, and ended up selling the Blu-Ray to someone. And that perfectly sums up MALEFICENT: it casts a spell on you once, but it soon wears off once you start thinking too much.",
41,unikorn-67905,4,Meh,This was an interesting twist on the typical Disney fare. It's like Pan's Labyrinth for the younger set.,
42,mpurvismattp,3,WRONG!!! Disney just crapped out another live action turd.,"I had to write a review of this movie to tell all of u out in IMDb land how terrifically horrendous this so called ""re-boot"" of the classic Disney fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"" is. The original beloved film, created in the golden age of the studios animation department is basically told to shut the Hell up and not get in the way of this new ""touchy feely"" version of every kid gets a trophy style movie making. This of course is supposed to appeal to as many people as possible while not scaring one child (cus ya know how fragile our youth are today, God forbid) while at the same time not showing any creativity, accuracy or entertainment, not even slightly. Now I'm not trying to say that this new film couldn't or shouldn't have the right to change a few things. After all it's a live action film and many decades have passed since the original was released. We would expect a few new or different things story wise and perhaps character wise but what we got was a totally different and in my opinion bland, heartless shell of the original film that at no point in the two hours I sat watching thought it added anything to the ""Sleeping Beauty"" story nor did it honor the Maleficent that we all loved to hate in the classic film. Jolie looks the part at least but the way the writers absolutely robbed the title character of her dastardly ways, and turned her from the evil sorcerous we came to love into some misunderstood fairy that lost her wings, this was just reaching too far for me. Losing her wings made her mad but never at any point slightly turned her to the dark side, wtf? The three fairies in the original film are not as magically gifted as Maleficent but are able minded and capable of some pretty nifty tricks when they need them and most importantly they are caring surrogate parents who deeply love Rose (Princess Aurora) like their own daughter. The new film makes them out to be idiots who have little reason for even being there. The creators also replace the fairies tender and loving relationship with a guilt ridden Maleficent who steps in as the one who cares for Rose, once again, wtf? Lastly King Stefan is not the caring and kind father of Princess Aurora who reluctantly gave his daughter up to hopefully spare her life and avoid Maleficent's evil birthday curse of death. The curse that one of the fairies finds a loophole for with her blessing of eternal sleep that can be lifted with a kiss of true love and which gives Aurora a sliver of a chance if she were to prick her finger on the spinning wheel as Maleficent had hoped. Every good character in this new film is changed to make them look incompetent, mean spirited, greedy or all of the above. This is to make Maleficent look like a victim of circumstance and more likable. The thing is she's not supposed to be likable, she's the villain remember? Bad job by Disney's live action department again (John Carter, The Lone Ranger, Alice in Wonderland, etc) and a bad movie is the outcome...again. Chances are its been a while since you've seen the original so please just go watch that and don't bother with this new ""installment."" Sometimes Disney has no shame when it comes to defiling the landmark pictures and characters that built their mighty empire. It seems that nothing is sacred and cheapening the great stories of their past is often dismissed or completely ignored as long as it makes a profit while doing so. It's not global famine or the end of the world of course but I think they should treat the works of their forefathers with a lot more respect and I find it a bit sad.",
43,noway234-1,1,"Maleficent, The Big Green Softie","Does anyone even remember the original Sleeping Beauty? I do, it was my favorite Disney movie as a child. I had an old VHS copy that I would watch every week, in love with the visuals and the dialog and every character. Maleficent was always my favorite villain, she was pure evil but reveled in it. She was joyous in just destroying a kingdom for no other reason than ""I didn't get an invite to a party"". She was the most evil character ever, her first action on screen was to attempt to kill a child. She was amazing. When I heard there was a movie about her, I was pumped. A full hour and a half showing Maleficent being evil, she would chew scenery and give us a fun thrill ride of a movie, it would be a departure for Disney but it'd be fun and epic in scope. I was prepared for fun.

I walked into the cinema and took my seat and was ready for fun... 5 minutes in, Maleficent has magically healed a tree and I realized the folly of my choice in movie. They took Disney's greatest villain, someone who was the purest of evil and loved it, and they turned her into a wood nymph that got raped by the prince and had a bad day. That's it, the wing cutting scene is a metaphor for Rape. That's not my interpretation, that was what they intended! The scene everyone was looking forward too (The curse scene) was an almost perfect recreation of the original movie and I was prepared to love it... and then, instead of Maleficent cursing Aurora to die, she cursed her with the threat of a coma. I'm sorry, that's not scary. The entire reason that Aurora had to be taken from the kingdom was because Maleficent had cursed her to die, Maryweather came up with the hail Mary pass of 'sleep' but they took her into the forest just in case Maryweather's spell didn't work. Here, they do it because they have too.

Oh, did I forget to mention that Maleficent spends the entire movie knowing exactly where Aurora is (Which in the original movie, she didn't, it was a plot point and everything) and even saves her life several times? They took the greatest Disney villain of all time, and literally had her pulling people's pigtails with magic.

Don't even get me started on the stupid ending, which is stupid and offensive in so many ways (The least of which is what it did to the story of Sleeping Beauty)

I have heard people say that it's a fun movie. I'm sorry, I spent all of it with my head in my hands wanting it to stop because it hurt to see a character I loved completely destroyed. This movie had the potential to be great, it had the potential to be something different. It was Wicked, except Wicked had the smarts to realize that yes, this character is Evil and while you can love her, she has to die at the end.

Thankyou Disney for ruining my favorite childhood villain.",
44,angie_l,3,Plot holes in a completely new version of Sleeping Beauty,"Overall, the movie was OK and I don't regret watching it. It was entertaining and beautifully shot even if many scenes were referential to other movies.

As for the acting, Elle Fanning was OK as Aurora though the character felt a bit empty but to be fair, there wasn't much in the script to work with. I wish she had a little more to her than childish goodness. There actually wasn't much for any of the actors to work with. I won't lie, I'm no fan of Jolie's acting, she comes across as haughty in every role, humility and vulnerability are completely outside her range. But, her haughtiness works here and she was good as Maleficent except in the scenes where she was supposed to be angry. I got no hint of her anger, fire, or passion, she was merely shouting. I wanted to feel her rage.

Biggest problem with the movie is the number of plot holes. There is no real explanation given for why the Moors and the kingdom of men are enemies. The king decides to attack for virtually no reason. The relationship between Stefan and Maleficent is graced over and yet this relationship goes to the core of Maleficent's being. We also see nothing of Stefan's life so we are unable to fully understand his actions and motivations. Stefan becomes mad and paranoid with no real love for his daughter and that just sort of happens. I could go on and on about things left with little explanation.

Another major problem I had was the previews of the movie lied to me in a big way. The movie wasn't a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from Mealficent's point of view, it was an entirely new story. I wanted to find out why Maleficent was evil - the maleficent I know and love/hate or hate/love. I wanted to see Maleficent's evil with new understanding. Let's face it, Maleficent was nowhere near evil in this movie, she's angry for a moment and that's it... which lead me to imagine other ways to tell the story. Perhaps, humans had seriously wronged her. Aurora was the child born to unite the 2 warring kingdoms of men and that Maleficent's plan was to stop this union for real substantial reasons - The story could have been easily told with a new perspective while being seamlessly woven into the known fairy tale. Every story has two sides, right?

In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this movie. If they were going to deviate so much from the known Disney or Perrault version, they could have fleshed out the story a little (lot) more.",
45,ToThePointPR,4,The Mistress of all Evil but the Mistress is a Stepmom and a Vindictive Ex,"This movie loses all of what makes Maleficent an interesting and memorable villain. She is the one, and only, Mistress of all Evil who was scorned by being the only one not invited to the coronation of Princess Aurora, with knowing nothing but evil, hatred and a willingness to make those who stand against her suffer. This movie however makes her a sensitive victim, a dark fairy with a heart and one who IS NOT evil and was scorned by the man she loved, and who stole her wings. Its dumb. Angelina does a fine job though.",
46,marcusman48,3,Maleficent is dead - and we have killed her!,"I have not felt this betrayed by a motion picture in literally years. What's especially sad is that I really, REALLY wanted to see it (and to like it, which I still would if it didn't stir up so much rage within me), and, while harboring no illusions that it would be great, I was sure it would be at least good. But SLEEPING BEAUTY (1959) is one of Disney's most perfect animated films and an indelible memory from my childhood. It was unique for its era: not so much Disney, per se, as it was ""Rankin-Bass does Disney and does a damned fine job of it."" It was my LORD OF THE RINGS when I was growing up. Now it is garbage, all thanks to MALEFICENT.

I hope that Walt Disney Pictures are pleased with themselves. They've taken one of the their greatest female villains - no, one of THE greatest female villains, Disney or not - and reduced her to an ice queen with a particularly bad case of PMS. For years Disney has been ruining other people's ideas; now they're ruining their own ideas as well. As Maleficent herself once said, I was left staring in shock and thinking: ""No!

It's particularly disappointing because the cover art shows a horned Angelina Jolie looking like Faye Dunaway on steroids, and Jolie does give a camp romp a la Dunaway or any of several other screen divas of malfeasance. But the feminist screenwriter can never make any sense of the story in any save political terms--male patriarchy bad, except for a prince who looks like a eunuch--while Maleficent, horns and all, comes out, I suppose, for female empowerment. Lots of bad decisions--besides using this script--occlude the thing as well. I think it was a bad idea to have Maleficent actually engage in combat with the forces of maledom, like a Superhero. It just looks goofy. The story is rewired grotesquely to accommodate the correct point of view with King Stefan (SPOLER) emerging for no reason except that thing between his legs, as the villain. Also gone are the core elements that make the story so endearing--the 100 year curse, the swarming thorn forest that hides the castle until Prince Charming hacks through it, and Maleficient's metamorphosis into a dragon. There is a dragon, but now he's a good dragon, that is, a contributor to NOW with an autographed pic of Bela Abzug on his wall, like the movie surrounding him, a need to vandalize the classics for this year's fashions. In fact so ridiculous is this one that Sleeping Veauty is only asleep for about 46 seconds!",
48,spitfire2356,2,What audience?,"First; I would like to complement the photography and CGI effects. Simply stunning - even if I only saw it in flat format. I am sure 3D was magical. Second; Angelina is superb as the betrayed angst ridden revengeful elf-witch which redeems herself. Her body and face are 'naturally' made up to be other-worldly looking. Bravo. The superlatives earn the 'deux points'. It is all downhill from here. Aurora is portrayed as a plain village idiot with an age of 6 though approaching her 16th birthday. She is soppy as cold soup and zaps away any magic from the movie . I understand nobody wanted to play second fiddle to Angelina - but there seems to have been a stampede. The king is just plain incompetent at being a father, king, warrior, and at destroying spindles and wings. He is incompetent at being evil - just contemptibly irritating. His choice of baby sitters proves the point. The fairies are beyond dumb, dumber and dumbest to be funny. The sidekick raven-man is a non-starter as a character. The prince Charming fizzled as a footnote to the story. Without character interaction, no story holds any interest whatsoever - ask my grandma. A timeless tale was savagely pruned to the trunk. Finally; just who was this movie aimed at?? It is too violent for kids.(PG my foot) It is too boring for adults. The 'twist' on the story could be seen a mile off. I was left with a bad feeling that this movie was a poorly disguised feminist vehicle.",
49,owlmarvel,3,Does not live up to expectations,"This film is poor, I think that the original Sleeping Beauty story is so much better and something I don't think I can rewatch it.",
50,acanacox,3,All star points go to Angelina,"My favorite Disney princess, villian, prince, artistic Disney film brought to life~ which no one asked for~ neither did I! I knew it was going to be a disaster~ you.dont.ever.recreate.a.brilliant.classic with realism~ especially when you mess up the whole movie script! The only Part I truly enjoyed was angelinas part. The famous quote ""well well....., oh dear, listen well all of you-"". That scene and her script lines was the only part I enjoyed until they just decided to add useless lines for her. Shes absolutely stunning looking so huge props to her makeup artists! Gahhhhhhhh they ruined everything about aurora!!!!! Absolute favorite princess doesn't come close to this actress's portrayal! I've seen Disney land character auroras that looked sooo much better and sorry~ prettier than this girl! ""Gold of sunshine in her hair~ lips that shame the red red rose""....nothing that fits that into this random girl! No clothes that resemble her outfit in the cartoon version! Give me SOMETHING that makes me think ""yea that's Aurora""! Her demeanor is nothing like that of the cartoon version! Belle in the realistic version was more alike of her cartoon self than this girl! Stupid crow part, stupid first kiss, stupid fight with the dragon, and of course the ending is nothing like the cartoon. I was incredibly incredibly dissatisfied that they didn't have the ""once apon a dream"" SINGING in the movie but only in the credits. The most well known song in that movie and they don't put it in~ yea yea yea it's about Maleficent, but at the same time aurora has basically more screen time. Disney you must be out of ideas for movies that allll you do is make realistic Disney classics into disasters that keep getting worse and worse and worse! Stay out of original Walt Disney's vault and stay in your own lane of creativity~ cuz this ain't it!",
51,LeonLouisRicci,9,True Love Comes In Many and Different Ways,"A bit Dark for a PG Rating so Parental Guidance is Advised. But the more
 Mature and Well Grounded Children are sure to Get a Thrill from this 
CGI Ride that is Full of Fantastic Images and Stirring Action.

It
 is Pathos that the Movie Embraces and the Good and Evil are Reversed 
somewhat but there are still Characters Worth Rooting for and others to 
Hiss and Boo. 

Haters of this Backstory seem to be Under the 
Delusion that the Original Fairy Tale and the Original Disney Animated 
Movie have been Purged from Existence with some Sort of Orwellian Eraser
 and Cease Existing to Enjoy.

Both are still there to be Perused 
and Appreciated, this is just something a bit Different, Not a 
Replacement. Angelina Jolie makes a Great Maleficent and is backed by an
 Array of Colorful and Interesting Fairies and other assorted Moor 
Magnificence. 

Thankfully there are No Outburst of Sappy, 
Old-Fashioned, Done-to Death Songs Interrupting the Story and it Plays 
out like a Truly Grim Fairy Tale. True Love comes in Many Forms and is 
not always found in a Traditional way, there could be others, and this 
is Not a Replacement, it's just Manifested in Another Form.

The 
Film certainly Looks Seamless incorporating Live Action and Animation. 
The Three Fairies are Amazing, and the Whole Movie is Spellbinding in a 
somewhat ""New"" Kind of Look from Modern Artistry.

Definitely 
Recommended for Those that Don't always Take the Path Well Traveled and 
are Willing to Accept and Embrace New Directions as New Entertainment 
and this Does Not Eliminate the Old, but Enhances with Enchantment.",
52,NijazBaBs,9,perfect 3d movie,"I like that we have the new perfect cartoon movie which made maximum use
 of technology (CGI) and good actors. Similar to other famous fairytales
 like Shrek (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), Ice Age (2002)
 and others. Graphics is similar in all, as is the story and stunts 
(flying, magic, war...). Also Angelina and others here look very 
confident playing their role, as if they are born for it. Unrealistic, 
but that is appropriate for such cartoon or kids movie. Bit negative at 
the end, but appropriate for the situation and earlier events, just like
 it is appropriate to defend ourselves in the war, even if we have to 
kill. The only thing I can't rate this the 10 stars is because the main 
actor Angelina is not living by the example outside of the movie too.",

55,rajatdahiyax,9,Not all stories are quite the same as they are told!!!!!!!,"""Maleficent"" explores the untold story of Disney's most iconic villain 
from the classic ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the elements of her betrayal that
 ultimately turn her pure heart to stone. Driven by revenge and a fierce
 desire to protect the moors over which she presides, Maleficent cruelly
 places an irrevocable curse upon the human king's newborn infant 
Aurora. As the child grows, Aurora is caught in the middle of the 
seething conflict between the forest kingdom she has grown to love and 
the human kingdom that holds her legacy. Maleficent realizes that Aurora
 may hold the key to peace in the land and is forced to take drastic 
actions that will change both worlds forever.",
56,doug_park2001,9,"""So you see, the story is not quite as you were told""",,"Angelina Jolie gives an outstanding performance as adult Maleficent; 
ditto for Isobelle Molloy as young Maleficent and Ella Purnell as teen 
Maleficent, a fairy with the body of a cute young fairy girl who matures
 into a beautiful woman with large, plain, but VERY powerful 
brown-feathered wings and twisted ram's horns. At an early age, 
Maleficent makes the mistake of befriending a human boy from the 
neighboring quasi-English realm who ultimately hurts and betrays her. 
From there, the story, with many clever deviations and without seven 
dwarfs, follows some of the rough pattern of the fairy tale popularized 
by the Grimm Bros/Charles Perrault and the earlier Disney movies. Elle 
Fanning also gives an impressive performance as Aurora (""Snow White"").

MALEFICENT
 strikes just the right balance of fantasy and reality, humor and 
horror, meaningful storyline and simple entertainment. There are all 
sorts of reasons to enjoy this film: The unique version of the story 
itself, the visuals, the character study of the protagonist, you name 
it. For me, the single best thing about MALEFICENT is its vivid 
portrayal of the Fairyland Moors, complete with pixies, elves, dryads, 
naiads, dragons, talking toads, Bokwus-like tree giants, and a host of 
others, including a were-crow.

This is a film without absolutes: 
No one is completely evil or noble, and no one, no matter how powerful, 
is invincible. MALEFICENT goes much deeper than the original tale of the
 handsome prince randomly falling in love at first sight with Sleeping 
Beauty and awakening her with a kiss from the evil swoon imposed by her 
horrible wicked fairy godmother. There are all sorts of big themes here:
 Good versus evil (and there are intermixtures of both in all the major 
characters), love versus lust, deception, greed, and so on. Many 
historical parallels can also be seen, the British Empire and American 
expansion to name just a couple. Yet, all the film's allusions will not 
get in the way of anyone who just wants to watch it for the rich and 
surprising ride it gives.

Some violent (and entertaining) battle 
scenes and disturbing images, but no serious gore. There's probably 
nothing here the average 8-year-old can't handle. Still, MALEFICENT is 
primarily a fairy tale for adults. Younger children may be confused by 
who they're supposed to root for, who's supposed to be ""good"" and who's 
supposed to be ""bad."" ""Good"" characters, after all, generally do not 
have horns. All the same, it provides a fine illustration of the 
complexities of human and other natures.

While the script and 
soundtrack could have been a little better in places, the whole quality 
of the acting, filming, and everything else is superb. Great use of 
Anglo-Celtic accents. Last but far from least, a beautifully fulfilling 
and well-earned ending."
57,beachy-38431,9,Better than what is written here.,Angelina Jolie made this movie (good). Elle Fannining ruined it.,
58,SofiaHedge,9,An Interesting Movie,"I have no idea why people tend to criticize this movie. Angelina Jolie 
did wonderfully as Maleficent, and it is nice to see the story from 
Maleficent's point of view. The acting. dialogue, and storytelling of 
the film are all very entertaining. The bond between Aurora and 
Maleficent is touching and heartfelt. And I like the dark tone. So 
overall, this movie is fantastic.",
59,EmmaDinkins,9,A Chix Chat On Film Review: New spin on a classic.,"This film was so creative and imaginative that it made me want to go 
back and review Sleeping Beauty just to map the correlations; this was a
 wonderful new spin on an old tale. Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) was not 
just a one dimensional villain; she was truly relatable and genuinely 
garnered sympathy for all that she endured. I wasn't surprised that she 
had been betrayed costing her to lose her wings, that much was fairly 
clear from the trailer although the extent of the betrayal wasn't clear 
until I experienced the film. Hell has no fury like a fairy scorned! But
 anyone who has ever been angry for any reason knows that it is very 
hard to stay in that place. The passage of time depicted as Aurora (Elle
 Fanning) grew was the best gauge for the changes in Maleficent's 
disposition. The story was very engaging to watch as Maleficent also 
grew. Hopefully, there won't be a crazy Hollywood band wagon of films 
based on every classic villain's perspective; that would be such a shame
 and would put me back on my soap box regarding a lack of originality. 
Shrek did it right and now so has Maleficent. There were so many 
phenomenal special effects in this film that it's hard to call out some 
as superior to others. With that being said, whenever Maleficent 
exhibited her powers the results were awe inspiring, from the floaters, 
to her in-flight and those amazing battle sequences. The special effects
 were as much a star of this film as the talented actors. I did feel 
like some of the magical creatures were recycled from the Spyderwick 
Chronicles, but most were new creations so that's only a minor 
infraction. With all the action, an engaging adventure and a female 
lead, this film is to be enjoyed by all. I'll suffice it to say that 
this is a great film to kick-off the start to the summer movie season 
for avid film lovers.",
60,CountVladDracula,9,Charming,"Maleficent is a beautiful movie. It has plot holes that are very easy to
 poke at but it's still decent and sweet. The ""true love"" aspect felt 
like a slight rip off of Frozen and I wish they could have given the 
prince a bigger role and or let there be romantic true love in there 
somewhere even if it was between Diaval and Maleficent. I freakin' love 
Diaval by the way.

There are a few things I prefer from the 
earlier script such as king Stefan secretly being half-faery and the 
bastard of a faery king so Aurura could end up developing her own faery 
magick (that was in the earlier script but not the finished movie). The 
three pixies are done better in the movie than in the earlier script 
though. In the earlier script they were kind of bitchy. Now they are 
just bungling.

Angelina Jolie plays the role so well that I 
actually felt bad when she woke up with her wings missing. Visually it's
 gorgeous. The creatures all resemble Brian Froud illustrations. My 
biggest complaint is Stefan. He was a bit over-the-top. Diaval is my 
favorite character though. He has this adorable, dysfunctional 
relationship with Maleficent.

For purists to the original fairy 
tale, the best way to look at it is it's an alternate reality because 
this is certainly NOT the Maleficent of the animated Sleeping Beauty. 
The fact that the three pixies don't even have the names from the 
animated film make that apparent.

You do have to shut your mind off a little but it is good enough a movie that you can ignore it's flaws.",
61,hoxjennifer,9,Angelina Jolie is Magnificent!,"Upon seeing the trailers for Maleficent, I was already excited to see it
 just from the concept of the film - classic fairy tale told from the 
""evil villain's"" point of view (which Disney should do more of if 
they're running out of material). And upon watching Maleficent in 
theatres last night, I was not disappointed. Angelina Jolie steals the 
show - she is absolutely perfect for the role, and the make up and 
costuming on her is just stunning. 

This movie is thoroughly 
enjoyable for all ages. This is a love story without the gushy stuff. 
This is a story about greed, revenge and redemption. Kids and adults 
alike will to be able to get something out of this film. Well done 
Angelina Jolie and well done Disney!",
62,cattjones,9,Sleeping Beauty to the Tenth Power,"I expected to see a film about sleeping beauty and I assume that most 
people expect the same. I was pleasantly surprised to be surprised. The 
film is not what I expected. I also did not see this film in 3D, which I
 regretted by the end of the film. I could see moments (a lot of 
moments) that would have been beneficial if they would have been in 3D. 
Angelina Jolie (Maleficent) did a brilliant job playing the betrayed 
fairy. I do have to say that her cheek bones were pointy to the extreme.
 Elle Fanning (Aurora) is really making a name for herself. I am sure 
that by now she is tired of playing a younger Dakota. The three 
baby-sitters in this film Lesley Manville (Flittle), Imelda Staunton 
(Knotgrass) and Juno Temple (Thistletwit) have to be the worse 
babysitters on the planet. They were very cute as fairies, but when they
 became normal, they were just idiots. Watching them as adults was 
pretty painful and reminded me of the Three Stooges (which I do not 
like). Sam Riley (Diaval) was my favorite character in this film. I 
think that he provided a sense of humanity and sensibility as 
Maleficent's sidekick. The one thing that I did notice while watching 
the film is that a lot of adults kept getting up and walking out (to go 
to the restroom, buy more food, whatever). It was as if they were bored 
because they already knew what was going to happen. I have to say that I
 felt that way too for a while. I even stepped out to return a call to 
my mom. Turns out that there is a twist to the story and when that 
happened, everyone was glued to their seat. I think that the star of 
this film was the imagery. The creatures and background in this film was
 really what captured the attention of the audience (myself included). 
This is a film that I may have to go back and see it in 3D. By the way.
 at the end of the film all the little kids in the theater applauded, 
which is always a good sign for a Disney film.",
63,fuelrodx,9,One of the better fantasies out there,"I'm not a fan of the fairy tale/fantasy genre, but this one is a cut 
above and Jolie did a good job and looked great for the part. My mother 
would have loved this one. This one also was made at the point where we 
had better CGI for this type of thing. They didn't make it look too 
cheesy either. That's another thing that can ruin this kind of film.",
64,TheReviewMaster,9,Maleficently Done,"I grumbled about watching this movie. I went into it already certain it 
was going to be drab, boring and a waste of my time. I still don't even 
know why I watched it. I'm glad I'm not always right.

The film is
 magical, with the fantasy world it's set in and the creatures that 
inhabit it seeming like a place that could actually exist (and if it did
 exist, I'd want to go there). The CGI was top-notch and the overall 
designs in every area of the film spectacular.

The highlight for 
me was James Newton Howards score: truly epic and complementary, hitting
 every beat with certainty (I will be listening to it over and over 
again).

Angelina Jolie even surprised me, for I've sworn off of 
her films for a while now. She was the perfect Maleficent, and I 
couldn't imagine anyone else in the role.",
65,agblum,9,"A Nice, Charming Movie","""Maleficent"" is a live-action re-imaging of ""Sleeping Beauty"", that like
 the Broadway Musical, ""Wicked"" based on ""The Wizard of Oz,"" tells the 
story from the perspective of the villain or antagonist – in this case 
Maleficent, played by Angelina Jolie. Without going into detail, the 
first 1/3rd of the movie chronicles the character of Maleficent's 
background, and how she came into contact with Stefan, played by Shartlo
 Copley, who goes onto to father of Sleeping Beauty herself, Aurora, 
played by Ellen Fanning. That portion of the movie shows what drives 
Maleficent to act in the manner in which she does, and in telling it 
from the perspective of her background, empathy is created for her. 
Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much, and found it very charming. 
Angelia Jolie plays the character very well, and the rest of the cast 
pretty much follows suit. The Visuals Effects while not always perfect, 
for the most part of well done. It is not outstanding, but for fans of 
the story, and if you have any affinity for fantasy in general – It's a 
nice movie. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars.",
66,jdavisjdavis,9,"A ""What if it were real"" Fairytale","The younger me would not have liked this, because I never liked remakes 
that changed the story. But the older me likes it quite a bit. Even more
 so that I'm reading the ""original unedited 1st edition"" Grimm Fairy 
Tales (in English) while I still read the lighter and newer versions of 
the same tales to my kids. So I get it now in more ways than one that 
there can be many versions of one story. Some of the old fairy tales 
don't really teach nice things to kids, so the stories get changed in 
modern day prints. Not only that, but even back in the 1800's when the 
Grimm brothers were writing the stories down after traveling around and 
gathering the verbally handed down stories, there are often two (or 
more) versions of the same story at that time floating around! So there 
is no perfectly ""correct"" version that exists that anyone can put a 
finger on to begin with.

This movie aims to approach a fairytale,
 a story that is obviously fabricated or exaggerated to the point of not
 being realistic, in a more realistic manner. Realistic in the sense of 
motivation, humanity, and plot I mean to say. It is still very much a 
fairy tale about magic and literal fairies, but it's something to watch 
and think about from a new angle. If you loved the first one, and I did 
as a very small child, then see this one not as a remake but as a 
completely different version of the same story. A ""what if"". Great 
stuff.",
67,vampiri,9,solid acting,"Recently there's been an influx in fairytale Movies and television 
series, i.e. Snow White and the Huntsman and Once Upon a Time, and other
 fairytale-like Movies, i.e. Oz the Great and the Powerful and Charlie 
and the Chocolate Factory. Most of them have done really well, and much 
due to charm and people's fondness of traditional good versus evil.

Plot: ambitious servant to the king sees his Chance to become king. Though successful, an evil curse is cast on his daughter...

Maleficent
 is no different from the above mentioned in style, nor in story. It is 
less ""grown-up"" than Snow White and the Huntsman, but darker than Once 
upon a Time. What separates this Movie from the others is the fabulous 
acting from every single actor/-ress (well, the major parts anyway).

I
 have never been a fan of Angelina Jolie nor Sam Riley (Control and 
Brighton Beach). The former mostly a bimbo with occasional parts in 
entertaining action Movies, the latter a stiff and boring actor in 
mostly flat Movies. But boy, do they deliver here!! Jolie's performance 
is outstanding and you could really see that she enjoyed her part which 
also is very far from what she has done Before. Riley has also outdone 
himself. Besides his performance in Control I'd say he's a mediocre 
actor, but here he has really found a perfect part to portray and 
manages to find the precise level of acting, meaning, neither over nor 
under acting.

Elle Fanning is Young and will have a fantastic 
career, she is really good here and her smile is a killer and really 
captures the innocent girl/princess.

Charlto Copley is a tricky 
actor. His style is weird and sometimes he is good and sometimes he is 
bad. Here he is somewhere in between and does not manage to convince, I 
feel he might be somewhat miscast.

Now I have said a lot about 
the acting, and this not without a reason. Maleficent skyrockets much 
due to the acting. The story is much too common and much of the details 
have been borrowed from Once Upon a Time.

The CGI work is really good and the details in the fairyland are top class.

I can't give it 10 out of 10 because it lacks that last bit which make a Movie a masterpiece.

If you like fairytale-like Movies like the ones I mentioned above you will enjoy Maleficent.

I give it 9 out of 10. I hope Jolie gets more serious parts now, she deserves it after her performance here.",
68,k-57285-16523,9,Human nature,"Overall ,the movie is good . The irresistible greed of humanity, 
selfishness, kindness, innocence, and destiny can be shown the fullest.

The movie also tells us not to tell others your secrets, including people you like.

Finally, Angelina Jolie is really beautiful ! ! !",
69,Dory_Darko,9,Don't believe the hate; Maleficent is magnificent.,"Today, June 4, I went to see Maleficent on the birthday of its star, 
Angelina Jolie. In itself, nothing more than a funny coincidence, 
although when you think about it, it is customary for someone who is 
celebrating their birthday, to hand out treats. And boy, this was the 
best treat ever.

Three reasons why I was completely stoked to see
 Maleficent after hearing about it for the first time about a year and a
 half ago: 1) I love Angelina. 2) I love Sleeping Beauty. 3) Maleficent 
is my favourite fairy tale villain of all time. On the other hand, I was
 also a little wary of the way they had apparently altered the story. 
See, if there is one thing I hate in films, it's when they explain and 
justify the motives and reasons why a certain character is ""bad"". I for 
one believe that some people are just plain evil and that's the way it 
is. And going into this persons' childhood and explaining how bad 
everything was (or something to that effect) only works to weaken that 
characters' force. Now, I don't know why a somewhat clichéd story about 
the love and betrayal of a young Maleficent (who apparently used to be 
good and pure-hearted), worked here, but somehow it just did. It 
completely surprised me, to be honest. I'm usually allergic to this kind
 of fluff, but it worked! Maleficents' back-story actually intrigued me,
 moved me even. And it succeeded at what it was supposed to do in the 
first place: it made Maleficent human.

In the end though, they 
could have written any kind of story about what is undoubtedly Disney's 
most beloved villainess, it never would have been raised to an above-par
 level without its most crucial element: Angelina Jolie. I might sound 
biased because I'm such a fan, but I am perfectly able to look at her 
performances in a critical way, and I can only say this about her 
performance as Maleficent: she was in one word, perfect. I honestly 
can't imagine any other actress who could have approached this role with
 the same flawless combination of properties (short of maybe Charlize 
Theron): she is beautiful and very charismatic, yet at the same time 
undeniably cruel and cold. She was everything I had hoped this real life
 characterization of Maleficent would be, and then some. 

Compliments
 also go out to the three other main actors in this film. First to Elle 
Fanning, for being very convincing as the young princess Aurora. She is 
sweet, lovely and kind and she has the right personality to play this 
famous princess just the way she should be. Second, to Sam Riley, who 
was a pleasant surprise as Maleficents' pet raven Diaval in human form. I
 was thus far unfamiliar with his work, but he was very well suited to 
his role and I enjoyed watching him. Last, but certainly not least, 
Sharlto Copley, who has already thrilled me with his performances in 
District 9 and Elysium, and who has now definitely made a fan out of me.
 His range is awesome and he was totally terrifying as Stefan.

OK,
 there are some things you have to look past. My first, and most 
blatant, issue with this film is: if young Maleficent was a good, pure- 
hearted girl, then why did she, as an innocent 10-year-old, already have
 evil-looking horns, devilish wings and is she called ""Maleficent""? 
Right Secondly, I found the three pixies to be very unconvincing and 
even somewhat annoying CGI-wise. Overall the special effects are well 
done but the pixies were definitely an eyesore. The dragon in the end 
also looked a bit unreal. 

That being said, Maleficents' costumes
 and make-up were absolutely stunning. I just couldn't get enough of 
gazing at her intricate headdresses and beautiful gowns. The costume and
 styling department really deserve top credit and I truly hope there 
will be some awards for them in the near future. The music was also 
great, with flawless scoring by James Newton Howard and a terrific 
rendition of ""Once upon a dream"" by Lana Del Rey over the end credits. 
Also, awesome battle scenes and action sequences galore!

Going 
into this film, I thought it would be nothing more than a so-so, kind of
 fun summer flick. A 6.5/7 maybe. Sometimes, I love it when I'm wrong. 
Out of the three films that I've seen at the cinema over the last week 
(the other two being X-Men and Godzilla, both disappointments) I can 
tell you, Maleficent was by far the most gratifying. Perhaps because I 
had relatively low expectations, perhaps because it was simply that 
good.

One serious warning for the rough, rugged men out there: 
this film features pixies, fairies, sparkly thingies and magical fluff 
out the wazoo. If you're going to see this, do it for Angelina. If not, 
treat this film like kryptonite. You will thank me later.

To everyone else: go see this film. It will rock your socks off. Maleficent is magnificent.",

-The Cast
-The 'From a Different Angle' Story
-The Shock Kiss

Absolutely brilliant! I can't fault it!
In that case it really should be a 10...........my only struggle was the
 fact I've rated Avengers: Endgame a 10 and for that reason I cannot 
justify any higher and I'm sorry haha
Giving this film a 9 though, in my view of films, is basically a perfect
 score for me! So it's all positive!!

P.s. I have noticed most 
reviews are pretty good, and the ones that aren't, seem to be people 
taking it WAY too seriously! 😂😂 ignore them please. It's fantastic I 
promise. #NoSpoilersHere",
72,merrilanil,9,Breathtaking,"I refuse to believe that there would be anybody alive who is not aware 
of this Angelina Jolie movie unless you have been cast away in a far 
away island and have been spending days cutting your hair and beard with
 blunt rocks.

Maleficent is undoubtedly one of the best 
performances by Angelina. Well of course there are so many other movies 
that shows her brilliance but Maleficent will stand out for so many 
reasons. First of all the whole look of the character and then the 
performance, the nuisances of the character and the quirky and the 
wicked evil act everything just was hundred fold in effect.

If 
you watch the movie, you will not stray anywhere from Angelina Jolie. 
Her screen presence is so much powerful that everything else actually 
fades away in comparison.

Well having said lets discuss other 
aspects of the movie, Plot is brilliantly developed only to be enhanced 
with performances by the actors present including Vivienne Jolie-Pitt 
(Angelina's real life daughter, even if it was for 5 minutes). The 
visual effects are absolutely breathtaking and dream like and making 
this movie one of a kind experience.

A truly must watch Disney Experience.",
73,kiransoorajkb,9,This is amazing! Definitely one of the best remakes and it's a must watch!!,"I absolutely loved this. A great take on the Sleeping Beauty tale. The 
visuals are really mind-blowing. Great acting by Angelina Jolie. I was 
really surprised seeing the bad reviews from critics. I definitely 
recommend this movie and it's a must-watch.",
74,pmullan-54285,9,"Wicked, but with Maleficent","""Maleficent""

Angelina Jolie is Maleficent, but she is no longer 
the nasty and sophisticated demon that was considered to be one of the 
best villains that Disney ever made, but she is now a misunderstood 
fairy who had been robbed of her wings and shoved into the battle that 
man brought upon her. But, it turns out that, when she curses the 
Princess Aurora on the day of her birth, she grows to like Aurora 
(Played by Elle Fanning) over the 16 years that she watches her. The 
three fairies are considered to be too thick to look after her and so 
Maleficent looks after the girl and even raises her. Okay, this is one 
of my biggest issues with the film, couldn't there be another way around
 Maleficent looking after Aurora than just having the fairies be thick? 
Couldn't she just talk to her or look after her when the fairies let her
 walk around the place, like in the original? There are so many ways 
around this topic, but they went the silly route. Negatives aside, I 
quite like the film. Angelina Jolie is not an actress that I'm familiar 
with, but she enlightened me in this movie. She looks the part and 
sounds the part, but the sympathetic approach can turn some people off 
when the original Maleficent is taken into account. No doubt, I love the
 original, but the new is also very good for me to see. I guess I like 
both original and new. Princess Aurora is considered to be one of the 
worst aspects of the original Sleeping Beauty, but I have been an Aurora
 fan since day one. I loved how she was portrayed here and it kept true 
to the original while giving something new. If you don't like new twists
 on old tales, then this ain't for you, but if you're open to some new 
ideas, then look no further.",
75,brycecab,9,"""Fairy"" satisfying and pleasing surprise!!","Sleeping Beauty, known as one of the greatest Disney classics ever, was 
one of my favorite Disney classics as a child. I remember glimpses of my
 childhood. I remember watching it with my aunt while my parents were at
 work. I liked it. The characters, the cinematography, the theme, the 
music, and most importantly the villain. The character, Maleficent, was 
very interesting to me when I was a child. As a kid, I thought that she 
was just doing what bad guys do those days, do something evil without 
any valid reason. Years passed by and I heard that there was going to be
 a film based and focusing on Maleficent herself. I was very interested 
with the concept of the summary. Maleficent, a character with great 
power, was getting her own live-action film. When I saw the trailers, I 
was fairly satisfied.

Robert Stromberg, the director of this 
film, did an amazing job bringing Maleficent to life. I liked the way 
the movie was presented. It gave a somewhat Tim Burton feel to it when 
watching the trailers but I was quite amazed with what it was. The CGI 
was very pleasing and satisfying. The cast was exceptionally good. 
Angelina Jolie as Maleficent was the perfect role for the actress after 
her break. It made her comeback seem very different. Elle Fanning was 
also a very pleasing Princess Aurora. With Sharlto Copley I wouldn't say
 his performance was great but fairly good enough. I am not sure if this
 is considered a spoiler or whatever but I loved the twist in this 
fairytale. The story and history between Maleficent and Stefan was well-
 thought out.

Overall, a satisfying fantasy based around true love with an incredible twist.",
76,kunagueroooooo,9,Just what the doctor ordered,"I came to this film, not liking Disney since the mid-70's, all the 
re-workings and re-imaginings rubbish. Then there's the politically 
correct nonsense of the noughties and now. Also I disliked Angelina 
Jolie with a passion, couldn't act her way out of a brown paper bag. So 
to be fair I wasn't expecting much if I managed to stay awake throughout
 it.
Well I will eat my words now, it's freekin' awesome. Everything about it
 makes you want to watch it again. All the actors and actresses were 
excellent. The CGI/animation was top draw, the storyline was beautifully
 told, and the live scenes blended in perfectly with the CGI/animation.

There
 were however two flaws in the film (3 if you include, it was over way 
too soon). The first flaw has to be there (the secret doorway) but did 
it have to be so blatantly thrown in there (oh what's this behind that 
massive blanket draped on the wall, oh its an unlocked door in my locked
 room). The second flaw should never have been there. The story is about
 Maleficent (obv.) and Sleeping Beauty, and herein lies the flaw. Elle 
Fanning is very pretty, no doubt but beauty, no sorry. Of all the 
beautiful actresses in Hollywood (and there is plenty) they pick a 
pretty one. One can only assume the head of the casting dept. had Elle 
Fanning's agent on speed dial.

That aside, the film is a must see, so go see it ;)",
77,turnewil-26767,9,Searingly intense,Ignore the trailer. Go see it. One of the most decent Disney movies that I seen.,
78,everton_hassmann,9,What a great movie (Maleficent),"Just one sentence is enough to describe this movie:
""The Story is not quite as you were told""

Great work of Angelina Jolie, perfect visual effects and brilliant history.
The light reflect on the eyes of Malificent gave a special touch to the scenes.",
79,ScottSF,9,Anelina Jolie is Ian McKellan good.,"The movie starts with jaw dropping visuals that slam the viewer into the
 world with white knuckle joy. The younger version on Maleficent is a 
character the viewer instantly loves and wants to protect just like 
Maleficent wants to protect her world. 

From unbridled joy to 
wild rage we are in Maleficent's corner and are on the edge of our seat 
wondering what she is going to do. Jolie gives a magnetic performance 
that holds your attention captive every moment she is on screen and her 
nuanced facial expressions speak volumes. 

In this fairy tale 
world things play out unexpectedly and if I had one criticism it would 
be in the portrayal of the true villain of the film. Clearly the focus 
was on Maleficent and how she chooses to deal with an egregious wrong 
against her but the story of the one who wronged her feels a bit 
truncated and clunky. Whereas everything about Maleficent is show not 
tell, as it should be, we are just told about the villain and don't 
really have an understanding of why he is who he is. 

The ending is emotionally satisfying and the film sustains a compelling charm even in the darkest moments.",
80,trevorstunt,9,Expectations,"Here is a film that lives to expectations. Building on Jolie's appeal 
and charisma, the film survives and impresses a completely different 
spin on the classic tale. We are given the back story on Maleficent's 
conflict with King Stefan, and throughout the new adaptation, we are 
treated to an expanded and revised version of the classic fairy tale. 
Disney has kept the look, adapted it to live action. We see the 
exquisite Medieval interiors of the castle, incredible costumes, from 
ladies' gowns to metal armors, and a dragon that manages to take our 
breath, even after that little creation in ""The Hobbit"" second entry.

Jolie
 of course, is the center, soul, and heart of the film, for no matter 
how charming and beautiful the other characters turn out, it is nearly 
impossible to take our eyes away from her. She is such a powerful force,
 magnetic, dangerous, exquisite, and with the ability to make delicious 
deliveries of lines to completely steal every scene she is.

Looking
 back, it is also notable that she doesn't have much of a speaking part.
 Much of her performance originates in the way she looks at the camera 
and uses facial gestures, and in more than occasion her body. Hers is a 
turn she was born to play, giving love (of more than kind), regret, 
disappointment, revenge, and more in less than 90 minutes. Her villain 
is one Disney's crowning moments.

This film explores her origins,
 the descent into mad revenge, and her discovery of what her nature 
truly is. Her character is powerful, yet there are imperfections, and 
those can become her undoing because much of the storyline centers 
around the issue of trust. Aurora's trust of her godmother, Maleficent's
 young romantic liaison, and other minor relationships'.

What at 
times was annoying and distracting in other films that combined drama 
and fantasy, this one has a great soul, one that completes a full cycle,
 but it wouldn't be disappoint if we got to see maybe another chapter 
about this amazing and seductive magical being.",
81,joemorgan-01462,9,A Joy to watch!,"This is certainly a different outlook into the character of Maleficent. 
It steers into the positive direction, as we see a lot of what of what 
is known in today's world, which would be the greed of mankind. This 
shows that representation in this very eye catching and terrific take of
 the classic anti hero.

Angelina Jolie was an excellent choice 
for the lead role of Maleficent and she certainly shows off her skills 
as an actress in this fine film. Her presence was always strong, but 
also her wit was always in the right place at the right time. A fine 
performance.",
82,Hendrik_Numiah,9,Beautiful and beautifully performed,"I don't quite understand where most of the naysayers are coming from. 
This movie is obviously not meant to follow the exact story of Sleeping 
Beauty! Makes me wonder why people are that narrow minded they can't 
understand that.

To the movie it is! As the title states, a 
beauty! From the first minutes on you get lured into a highly crafted 
fairy world. And with little effort you can imagine yourself being there
 or wishing you were part of it. The CGI's are of exceptional quality, 
sometimes making you guess if what you see is real or animated. Not 
being a big fan of Angelina I went in a little biased. Was I wrong! She 
performed the stars out of the sky imho. Cold when she needed to be 
cold, and warm when she meant to be fuzzy. The way she pronounced 
""Beasty"" made me glow and tingly all over. Elle Fanning is turning out 
to be a great actress with a great future ahead. Not dull at all. The 
make-up is from another world as well. The brute forms and the deep red 
lips (MAC) indented my retinas for the rest of my life.

Story 
wise it's very entertaining as well. You get dragged into the story from
 the get go and it won't release you till the end. Of course it's a 
fairy tale. And as usual all fairy tales have a happy ending. We all 
know that going in. But this one is brought to you like sweet cotton 
candy. Yummy!

Being not easily impressed, I am today. 9 stars out of 10 for the sheer beauty en performances.",
83,flagmichael,9,... like a woman scorned.,"Disney, right? I expected a pleasant movie with two-dimensional 
characters and maybe a nice soundtrack. A wicked villain was a foregone 
conclusion. What I saw was something very different, very much darker, 
with genuine human meaning. Wickedness is one thing, but this is a study
 in the contagion of sheer evil feeding on very normal human emotions. 
My wife and I watched it partly to see if it was okay for our 
grandchildren, who are okay with Godzilla and Jurassic Park. Hah! A 
battle scene had already convinced us the wee ones were not ready yet, 
but later scenes, including one of unvarnished horror, makes this movie 
under-rated at PG... I don't recommend it for teens under 16. But for 
adults it is a great film. The same human passions make it fascinating 
and Angelina Jolie delivers the performance beautifully. Of course the 
visual effects are stunning, but even there the characters' emotions 
come through. What hath Disney wrought? We have always assumed a G 
rating for Disney films but this is several steps into the darkness. As 
with Breaking Bad, I find myself wishing it were not done so very well.",
84,mattjeanes,9,Magnificent,"This is, without doubt my movie of the summer, after disappointments 
like Godzilla, Jersey Boys , Mrs. Brown' s Boys ( I hoped!!) , this was 
an amazing breath of fresh air, amazing visuals, story telling and a 
staggering lead performance by Jolie make this my film choice of the 
year. Initial critical slamming has paved way for credit where credit is
 due with those critics who saw its worth now thumbing their noses at 
the ones who didn't. It has all the darkness and passion of a story told
 to you when you were a child,, but now we are adults it still has that 
magic to enthral.. A dark take with a cool message. I can't wait to see 
it again and judging by the repeat business world wide, I think this 
character will go down in movie history. Loved it",
85,Movie_Fanatic_Down_Under,9,Maleficent? More like Magnificent!,"IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!

I saw this movie tonight with a 
friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long 
Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of 
movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more
 wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a 
well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain 
relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a 
convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.

The CGI is a tad heavy 
and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies/Aunts) 
but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a 
fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful 
and imaginative work in movies such as ""Hellboy 2"" and ""Pan's 
Labyrinth"". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you 
into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish
 you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your 
imagination.

Although Maleficent's character has been humanised 
in this re-telling, the story really emphasises that she isn't human at 
all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to 
the humans she encounters.

The plot for this movie really fits 
into the current trend of exploring the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, 
Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past 
depiction of characters being black and white, good or evil, etc.

I
 feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover I 
have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with 
kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the 
film but I won't discuss those here.",
86,phd_travel,10,Magnificent,"Maleficent is magnificent. The story is sophisticated enough to delight 
adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a 
delightful twist including the meaning of true love. The characters are 
sympathetic and there is enough excitement.

The art direction and
 cinematography are beautiful. The fairy land scenes resemble a pre 
Raphaelite painting. The castle was a bit generic CGI. The right blend 
of human faces with CGI so it didn't look too animated. The director 
Stromberg who did Oz the Great and Powerful did an even better job here.

Angelina
 Jolie's expressive face is the perfect showcase for the character - it 
is the role of her lifetime. Like the way they did her cheekbones to 
make it like the Disney cartoon. Sam Riley as her sidekick morphs into 
many fairy tale creatures crow, dragon horse. The creatures are well 
done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming. Elle Fanning is sweet
 and picture perfect for the role of Aurora and Brenton Thwaites plays 
her prince. The fairies including Juno Temple and Imelda Staunton are 
cute too.

Liked this more than the Snow White movies 'Mirror 
Mirror' and 'Snow White and the Hunstman'. The first was fun but a bit 
silly and the second was too grim. Maleficent is the perfect blend of 
excitement and fairy tale. Most enjoyable film of the year.",
87,Rainey-Dawn,10,Breathtaking Beauty,"Breathtaking - Beautiful! Everything from the costuming, to the sets, to
 the script and acting --- it's all breathtaking. There is no overuse or
 misuse of CGI effects in this film. The entire film is done in very 
good taste and style. Outstanding performances by the entire cast - 
Jolie is at her finest in this film. This movie quickly became a 
favorite fantasy film for me.

It has a slight twist to the 
classic fairytale - which made the movie even better (IMO) and is 
perfect for fans of the villainess/heroin Maleficent.

Maleficent (2014) is good film the entire family can enjoy and would make a great Halloween family film.

9.5/10",
88,cherold,10,Best fairytale movie since Stardust,"I watched Disney's Sleeping Beauty for the first time about a year ago. 
Maleficent was a fascinating villain, and one I could see being scary to
 small children, but I was bothered that she seemed so hellbent on 
destruction with absolutely no reason. Even evil people usually have 
*some* reason for what they do.

Perhaps this also bothered the 
writer of Maleficent, who gave the character a back story in this 
revisionist fairy tale. This time around, Maleficent is a nice fairy 
who, after some very bad experiences, gets very angry and goes on a 
vengeance bender.

Angelina Jolie is indescribably wonderful as 
Maleficent, beautifully riding the line between the sardonic, cackling 
cartoon villain and this movie's hurt, broken, and very powerful woman.

I
 also quite liked the treatment of Aurora. In the original cartoon she 
was one of those painfully bland Disney princesses they had before their
 resurgence in the 80s and 90s. While Disney has tended to give later 
princesses more personality by making them feistier, Aurora is still 
just as sweet as pie. But Elle Fanning is so radiantly positive and 
likable that she completely avoids the simpering tendencies seemingly 
inherent in such a role.

The movie has gorgeous special effects, 
whimsical humor, and an engaging story. It does a really nice job of 
matching up with certain scenes from the original. It is also 
wonderfully touching; I haven't actually cried this often during a movie
 in years.

From looking through some of the reviews, it seems the
 people who most hate this movie had very specific ideas of what it 
should be. Many wanted Maleficent to be the evil character they 
remembered, with simply the story told from her point of view. But 
having seen the cartoon only once, as an adult, I have no attachment to 
the original.

This makes me the ideal viewer for this film. If 
you've never seen Sleeping Beauty you'll miss a lot, but if you watched 
it over and over as a kid you may have too many preconceptions to fully 
enjoy it.

There were small flaws. Portraying the fairies as 
Three- Stooges-level idiots wasn't as humorous as intended, and the 
changes in the curse seemed to be an unnecessary softening, but this 
movie is so magical and so lovely that these minor quibbles barely 
registered.

I love this movie. I love it so much that I feel like
 putting a curse on everyone who doesn't like it. That's just the 
Maleficent in me.",
89,Bored_Dragon,10,"""Truth"" behind Sleeping Beauty fairy-tale","Told from the point of view of ""evil"" fairy who cast the curse. Disney 
finally decided to leave behind black-and-white, two-dimensional, ""good 
vs evil"" way of portraying the world and released magnificent anti-hero 
movie in shades of grey. ""Heroes"" do not look so innocent any more and 
""villain"" gets proper background story that explains how it came to the 
story we remember from our childhood. Either this story has no holes or I
 missed them being hypnotized by beautiful scenery and wonderful 
effects. Elle Fanning is not as beautiful as her character name tells 
but she played her role very well, while Angelina Jolie nailed hers. 
There's no point to further analyze this movie because I have no 
objections at all and if I start praising its qualities it could take 
forever. It's simply perfect, maybe even the best Disney feature film so
 far. Although it's tight race with Pirates.

96,Figgy66-915-598470,10,Took me right back to my childhood,"9 May 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Maleficent. I
 have been waiting for this film for a long time. I had two points of 
personal interest... Ella Purnell who plays the teen Maleficent is 
related to my friend and I have known her since she was quite young and 
the film company bought a lot of spinning wheels from Frank Herring and 
Sons Ltd where I work. Ella, who was was almost unrecognisable in her 
make up, made the part her own and played the young Maleficent 
beautifully, leading into Angelina Jolie as the adult. Not one of my 
favourite actresses, I must say she was brilliant in this part. This 
film was a traditional fairy story with a modern slant and a twist to 
the well known tale of Sleeping Beauty. Dramatic make up and lighting 
combined with anger, sadness, obsession, love and a sprinkling of humour
 combined to take me right back to my childhood and the stories I knew 
and loved then. I always think a sign of a good film is if I don't 
fidget in my seat and I didn't move once through this film. I'm going 
back to see it on Sunday in 3D.",
97,bhernandez2216,10,Maleficent,"Maleficent is pretty cool, once you get to know Disney. Angelina Jolie

Maleficent as an extremely beautiful villain despite her evil nature. I 
love how this movie, combining live action with CGI, completely re- 
invented the Sleeping Beauty story allowing Maleficent's character to 
change throughout the movie giving her more depth as well as portraying 
the male characters differently from the original fairy tale. I do not 
wish to put too many details in my review that might spoil it for those 
who haven't seen it yet but I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to 
anyone who has fond memories of the original 1950s animated version. I 
truly believe you will find this movie most interesting at the very 
least.",
101,MartinHafer,7,"Provided you can completely forget the story you already know, it offers some interesting of interest.","If you are looking for a live-action version of the old Disney film ""Sleeping Beauty"", then you will be in for a BIG disappointment. Instead, ""Maleficent"" is a lot like a re-inventing of the old story. While some might say this is horrible, it must be remembered that there is no ONE definitive tale of ""Sleeping Beauty"". Perrault wrote down this and other French fairy tales (such as Cinderella) but they, like the Brothers Grimm stories in Germany, were folk tales--ones with many, many variations. So, if you look at the film as just a variation of the old story, it's much easier to enjoy.

In this version, you get back story as to who Maleficent was--both when she was nice and when she turned mean, much because of a jerk-faced King who was nasty to her (Sleeping Beauty's jerk of a father). While I thought all this had way too much CGI and was at times very distracting, I did love the 'love's first kiss' angle--one that flies in the face of the ludicrous love at first sight crap!

My verdict is that this certainly is no classic but the story is worth seeing. Neither brilliant nor an abomination--it reminds me of some of the newer children's story books such as ""The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig"" or ""The True Story of the Big Bad Wolf""--stories that stand the older versions on their heads!",
102,claudio_carvalho,8,The Absence of New Ideas Reaches This Point,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is a well-known classic fairytale by the Brothers Grimm perpetuated through several generations.

""Maleficent"" rewrites the tale but is not a bad movie; on the contrary, has a good story, screenplay, performances and special effects. Unfortunately it shows the present absence of new ideas from the writers that need to destroy or remake what does exist and is excellent. When it is a classic like ""Sleeping Beauty"", the procedure is very sad for those that have spent their lives worshiping the wonderful fairytale. My vote is eight.",
103,kosmasp,8,It's fantasy,"I have to admit, I was expecting this to be darker. The promotion they were making with this was all: this is not your usual bed night story. Well it kind of is. It might be a tad darker than the usual Disney inspired stories, but it's still not something that was made for adult (and that is a good thing) ... they should just stop promoting movies in a false light like that.

So my first reaction to the sort of usual story wasn't real excitement. But thinking about it afterward, I have to admit, the story is pretty solid (if very predictable) and Angelina has another standout role to look back to. Your children should be OK, if there are not too little to watch this too. Fairy tales are supposed to be a bit scary ... a bit, like this one",
104,Tweekums,8,An interesting retelling of a classic fairy tale,"This live action Disney film shows the story of Sleeping Beauty from the other side; focusing on Maleficent, the 'evil' fairy who cursed her. As the story opens we are told how there are two neighbouring kingdoms; one of greedy humans and another of friendly magical folk. Maleficent is a young fairy who lives in the latter. One day she meets a human boy named Stefan. They become friends but ultimately he comes to see her less and less. The years pass and Maleficent grows up. Then the human king attacks the fairy realm but it thwarted by Maleficent. He promises his kingdom to the man who rids him of Maleficent; Stefan uses her trust to get close to her and then betrays her. He becomes king and has a daughter, named Aurora. On the day of her christening Maleficent places a curse on her... a curse that will take effect on her sixteenth birthday. She grows up in the care of three fairies and with Maleficent keeping a watchful eye to ensure nothing happens to her before the curse is due to take effect. Inevitably the day of her sixteenth birthday approaches and Maleficent starts to regret cursing Aurora; will anybody be able to prevent it happening or end it if it does occur?

The way the focus of the story is moved to Maleficent is rather fun; she starts off as one of the good people before the act of betrayal leads to bitterness and a desire for revenge. This doesn't mean she comes across as evil or as a real villain. She is shown as a caring character who comes to regret actions made in anger. If there is a real villain of the film it is Stefan; the betrayer who's actions started the curse. There are plenty of exciting moments throughout the film leading up to a finale that should be exciting for children and adults alike... and perhaps a little too scary for some younger viewers. The story ends in a way that should be pleasing for most viewers. The cast is solid with Angelina Jolie standing out as Maleficent; just menacing enough to be seen as dangerous without being evil. The special effects are really impressive; especially the various magical creatures. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those who like new takes on old stories.",
105,paul_haakonsen,7,A great take on the classic fairytale...,"I had been waiting to see this movie for some time, and I must say that now that I have, I am pleased to say that Disney did deliver as expected here.

The movie was a great and interesting take on the sleeping beauty story, and it managed to capture the essence of the fairytale, but also added much more to it. It was especially great to see the story from the ""villain's"" point of view. But of course, this story differed quite much from the original story.

There is little need to go into the storyline here, as it is a class fairytale that I believe everyone should be familiar with. But director Robert Stromberg managed to get a great twist on the tale.

""Maleficent"" is a movie driven by its storyline as much as it is driven by the CGI effects. And wow, the effects in the movie were impressive. The marsh really had that enchanted fairytale-feeling to it with the vibrant colors, the marsh inhabitants and the general appearance of the place. And the effects team really managed to pull it off nicely turning the enchanted marsh into a gloomy and dark place once Maleficent had a change of heart.

As for the cast, well no doubt about it that Angelina Jolie really carried the movie quite nicely. And the costume and make-up for her was just mind-blowing. If they hadn't gotten Angelina Jolie for the role, I think that Famke Janssen could have been just as great in the role.

""Maleficent"" is a great twist on the classic fairytale, and it is well worth watching, as it is entertaining and visually nice to look at.",
106,tavm,8,I loved this recent take on the villainess Maleficent-here depicted as having a compelling motive for her actions,"Just watched this-a revisionist take on the villainess Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty-with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew. Angelina Jolie was quite compelling as the fairy-turned-witch who then rediscovers her good side when she sees how Aurora (Elle Fanning) often takes a positive view on her life. Lots of charming twists on certain characterizations where you wonder who's the real villain and how things are changed based on what you know about the tale. Really, I couldn't get enough of the visual splendor or the bombastic score and the humor concerning the three fairies were amusing enough, if not hilarious. So on that note, Maleficent was quite an epic spectacular well worth seeing!",
107,writers_reign,7,La Jolie Femme,"Given her penchant for appearing in things like Lara Croft, Salt, etc, and my preference for real films I have only seen Angelina Jolie in one movie, Changeling, in which I thought she was excellent. I think she also does a good job as the eponymous Maleficent where, coincidentally, an arguably finer actress than Jolie, Lesley Manville, is wasted in a joke role which is underwritten to boot. It's a nice take on The Sleeping Beauty though the song from the original Disney animated version, Once Upon A Dream may well be lost on younger viewers who were not going to movies in the early fifties - and while we're about it whose bright idea was it to drop Tchaikovsky's name as composer. The film is shot in somber tones so that even the few scenes that call for sunlight are muted. Definitely rates a look.",
108,view_and_review,8,Magnificent,"So, I looked the word up because I initially thought that it was two words combined to make one like ginormous. I figured it was a combination of malicious and beneficent, which would be mixing two opposing words together, but then it would make a LOT of sense for this movie.

Maleficent, like Wicked, is a retelling of a popular story from a different perspective; and in this case it is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty. This version would be like Sleeping Beauty meets Lord of the Rings as there was a bit of LOTR touch to it at certain points.

The movie was cinematically wonderful. The setting, the make up, costumes, CGI and effects were all excellently done. When things were dark it really conveyed the mood and when things were bright it did likewise. The movie was narrated at times which was helpful to speed things along. There were a wide swath of emotions throughout the movie but the movie never got too complicated to where children can't follow it.

Jolie did a wonderful job, you could say she made the movie. Without a doubt the movie rested upon her delivery. A solid summer movie well worth watching.",
109,george.schmidt,8,Game of Horns; Jolie delivers the goods in a fairy-tale re-imagining,"Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Sharlto Copley, Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple, Sam Riley,Brenton Thwaites, Kenneth Cranham, Hannah New (Narrator: Janet McTeer) Inventive live-action Disney adaptation of one of their classic animated films ""Sleeping Beauty"" this time from the perspective of evil fairie Maleficent (Jolie, born to be bad, is splendid) whose vengeance for heartbreak is the backstory of this re- imagining of the fairy tale and an origin story too boot. Linda Woolverton's screenplay leans a tad too-good-to-be-true and lightening the darkness to shades of grey in one of cinema's greatest villainesses but it works well with Robert Stromberg's fanciful direction (taking a page out of Tim Burton's 'freaks are people too' filmmaking) and a grand production design by Dylan Cole and Gary Freeman, a Danny Elfmanian score by James Newton Howard, gorgeous lensing by cinematographer vet Dean Semler and some fine-tweaking digital assisted make-up design by wizard Rick Baker giving the aquiline Jolie jawline planes so sharp it'd cut ice. Fanning is proving to be an up-and-coming-actress-of-her-generation as the sweet Aurora while Copley's callow anti-hero power-hungry king has shades of Alan Rickman oiliness. The 3-D is worth the extra fee for a genuine story book panache.",
110,gradyharp,8,A Precursor to Sleeping Beauty,"Linda Woolverton has adapted Charles Perrault classic novel 'La Bell au bois dormant' and provides a background for the famous fairy tale. Robert Stromberg directs

A beautiful, pure-hearted young woman, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) has an idyllic life growing up in a peaceable forest kingdom, until one day when an invading army threatens the harmony of the land. Maleficent rises to be the land's fiercest protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayal - an act that begins to turn her pure heart to stone. Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces a battle with the invading king's successor (Sharlto Copley) and, as a result, places a curse upon his newborn infant Aurora (Elle Fanning). As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom - and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well.

A colorful cast acting out this very Disneyesque movie is tremendously aided by the production design by Dylan Cole and Gary Freeman and the CGI effects. For a film in this genre it is strong if a bit beyond credible too often. But then it is make-believe.....",
111,trashgang,8,great flick made for adults??,"Not bad at all coming out of the Disney studio's. Everybody knows that this isn't my favorite studio but I gave it a try due the 3D experience and I must say that it wasn't really a movie for the kids.

It all starts rather childish with the elves and all kind of wood creatures and once loves come in it could become a typical sugared love story so true to Disney but luckily it didn't. Once the betrayal comes in this flick turns into a dark fairytale.

Angelina Jolie is excellent here as are the special effects used to create good and evil. On part of the 3D it all looked stunning and the movie didn't bore me one minute. But I must admit that it isn't made for kids under ten, therefor the story is a little bit too dark.

112,siderite,7,Intriguing twist on the Sleeping Beauty tale,"Keep in mind that this is a Disney movie based on a fairy tale. The expectations should be low enough to make this film a very good effort. It's like Syfy doing something watchable! Also, they had ample opportunity to screw up either the story or the overall production of the film and they did not.

The main plot is that of Maleficent (kind of a ridiculous name) which is the strongest fairy in a magical land which borders the human realm. Predictable enough, humans covet the land and want to conquer it. After some battle and some deception, Maleficent is really angry with human folk and unleashes the curse. What happens afterwards and the deception I was talking about is where the twist happens.

I have to say that Angelina Jolie made this movie good. The ridiculous standins for ""always cheerful and kind girl"", ""wacky pixies"", ""prince charming"" and even the ""evil king"" were as cardboard as they can be. Some scenes were so ridiculous that I thought the actors were cheaper replacements for CGI (see the scene where the child is born and the hand maidens are all abuzz). The always helpful servant was an interesting character and it was bad that they didn't expand on it. Who knows, perhaps in Maleficent 2. Either way, Jolie's almost magnetic acting saved the movie from mediocrity and made it stand out. And I don't normally like the woman, so I am not biased.

Bottom line: a mediocre Disney movie with an interesting twist and magnificently evil acting from Angelina Jolie.",
113,OllieSuave-007,7,Sleeping Beauty turned upside down.,"If you are a hardcore Disney fan who relish the traditional story of Sleeping Beauty, then this film is not for you. However, if you enjoy a good 360-degree twist to a fairytale, then give this film a go.

A spin-off from Disney's 1959 film adaptation of the classic fairytale, this movie, according to the narrator, is about the true story of the villainous fairy Maleficent and how a betrayal and an attack by King Stefan's army against her peaceful forest kingdom led her to become evil and to curse Stefan's newborn daughter Aurora.

This movie's plot goes at a fast momentum, making each scene interesting and attention grabbing, leaving no room for monotonous and unexciting elements. The visual effects were done quite well and made careful utilization of CGI in generating some colorful and bright visuals, particularly in the effects of the good fairies and the forest kingdom creatures. James Newton Howard gave a wonderfully adventurous and haunting music score and the acting performances were pretty good for the most part. Angelina Jolie gave a brilliant performance as Maleficent and Elle Fanning gave a down-to-earth and spirited performance as Aurora. Sam Riley as the raven-turned-human servant Diaval also gave a touching performance. The rest of the cast performances was a little sub-par, particularly that of the emotionless King Stefan and the bubble-headed three fairies (the Flora, Fauna, Merriweather-based characters). However, it was interesting to see how each of the characters came to be and what the true backgrounds of them were when compared with the original animated Sleeping Beauty movie (i.e., Maleficent's pet raven/servant offered to be her servant after she saved his life).

***spoilers ahead, but does not give away ending*** While the casual fantasy/fairytale movie viewer might enjoy this movie, those who are loyal to the original Sleeping Beauty story and the 1959 animated adapted film version might not like the movie because it retells Sleeping Beauty in a different point-of-view. I thought that this story revealed why Maleficent turned evil and that she would remain dark and wicked throughout the film, with plot elements mirroring that of the animated movie. However, the story is mostly different as Maleficent was portrayed as not truly evil, just vengeful (I would have preferred her to be more dark and sinister). And, Aurora's slumber, Prince Phillip's role, King Stefan's true purpose and the Three Good Fairies all weren't what they seem. Therefore, instead of a movie that further details and expands the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, it changes it. I would have preferred screenwriter Linda Woolverton to have scripted the movie that follows the animated movie storyline with expanded plot elements instead of the story that was produced, as I think her approach might make people, especially those who grew up watching the animated version, think they were told the incorrect or false story - can't help but think it deprives them of a childhood memory or they were deceived all these years. ***spoiler ends***

Overall, despite the fact that I wished the movie's story would have been scripted differently to be more faithful to the original Sleeping Beauty fairytale and the animated film, this movie as itself is a pretty good fantasy adventure nonetheless.",
114,Hellmant,8,If you think 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' and 'THE HOBBIT' movies are bad you definitely won't like this!,"Disney's live-action 're-imagining' of their animated classic 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' (based on the fairytale by Charles Perrault, and adapted by the Brothers Grimm). This version centers on the villainess Maleficent (and makes her a sympathetic antagonist) by telling her origins story; as a strong heroic fairy, who was betrayed by the human boy she loved. Angelina Jolie stars as the title character, Elle Fanning plays the young princess she curses (the 'Sleeping Beauty') and Sharlto Copley plays the male villain of the film (an evil king who betrayed Malficent, by steeling her wings). It was directed by first time film director Robert Stromberg (a veteran visual effects artist) and written by Linda Woolverton (who also wrote the 2010 Disney live action update to 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND' and co-wrote 'THE LION KING'). Purists (who don't approve of a lot of creative liberty) will hate this movie but I found it to be immensely entertaining.

The movie begins with Maleficent (Jolie) as a young fairy (Ella Purnell and Isobelle Molloy, at different ages) who lives peacefully in the magic realm of 'The Moors'. She falls in love with a young boy, named Stefan (Michael Higgins), from the human world next to hers. As the boy gets older (Copley) he becomes obsessed with becoming king, like his father King Henry (Kenneth Cranham), and stops visiting Maleficent. After Maleficent leads her people in battle against King Henry's invading army, and defeats them, Stefan betrays her. He steals her wings, by cutting them off with iron (the only thing that can hurt fairies). Stefan does this to become king, by impressing his dying father, which upsets Maleficent so much that she becomes evil and dark hearted. She gets her revenge by cursing Stefan's newborn baby, Aurora, to fall into a sleep like death (on her 16th birthday). Stefan then sends the baby into the woods, with three pixie guardians, to protect her. Maleficent learns of her whereabouts and watches her (from nearby). She sees her grow into a strong young woman (Fanning) and begins to see the beauty in the world, once again, through her. At the same time Stefan grows mad, with vengeance on his mind.

To say the film takes a lot of creative liberty, with it's source material, is an understatement; this is practically a completely different fairytale. If you think 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' and 'THE HOBBIT' movies are bad you definitely won't like this. The basic plot points are the same but the central characters are almost completely different (the title one most of all). Jolie looks great in the part, and gives a decent performance, but still it's not the same character as classic literature (or the Disney animated film). Even so I still really enjoyed the movie. It looks beautiful and it's surprisingly emotional and sweet. I predicted the ending (about halfway through the film) but I still really liked watching it play out (and was very moved by it). It's great to see two strong lead female characters (in a fantasy/action flick) and a central relationship story all about them. Almost every male character in the movie is either an idiot, evil or crazy (but I didn't mind that either). It's a highly enjoyable film in my opinion, even if it bares almost no resemblance to the original.",
115,FeastMode,8,i really love this movie,"Awesome movie, awesome story, awesome scenes, awesome job by angie in becoming the character and also in her overall acting job throughout the movie. They did a great job of getting you emotionally invested in the characters, both good and bad. And Maleficent is one of my favorite characters ever. she consistently made me feel for her and root for her. She's a straight BEAST too.",
116,Lejink,8,Wake me up before you glow glow,"A nice movie to watch on a Sunday summer evening. Disney's sort-of-prequel live-action feature is big on production values and certainly on Angelina Jolie, who keeps Sleeping Beauty off-camera for about half the movie. In this re-telling of the fairy story, we get to see the motivation behind the not-so-wicked witch's curse on the young princess, so much so that you end up almost rooting for her to have her evil way, so badly is she treated by her one-time young boyfriend, now the grown-up paranoid King, the oddly Scottish-accented Stefan (see what you started Mike Myers?).

Of course, being Disney, the cute factors are raised to the factor triple-x as witness the three pixies charged with protecting the baby girl in her youth, a humanised raven which becomes Maleficent's conscience and a mop-haired prince who in a neat twist doesn't do what he ought, according to the legend.

Jolie it must be said is very good in the title role, her jet-black hair and razor-sharp cheekbones to the fore. The effects are excellent too, especially the depictions of a fairy grotto with brightly-coloured fairies lighting up the place, the forest of thorns and Diaval's transformation into a fire-breathing dragon at the conclusion. I also liked the twist as Aurora is wakened from her sleep at the second time of asking and the exciting SFX finale between Maleficent and Stefan.

I would carp at one or two modern-phrases which wincingly crept into the dialogue (one pixie criticises another for ""having a go at her"") but you'd have to have the heart of a fairytale malevolent King not to enjoy this lovingly made film which well complements its animated predecessor from over 60 years ago.",
117,richardchatten,8,Fairy Story,"A slick live-action retelling of 'The Sleeping Beauty' with Angelina Jolie - with horns giving her the appearance of a big sexy stag beetle - giving the title witch all the hard elegance Disney originally gave the wicked queen in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves', plus heart (albeit a black one), sharp blood red lips, sharper teeth and even sharper cheekbones and an occasionally boisterous sense of humour.",
118,bowmanblue,7,Evil has never looked so good,"Okay, so, like many, I grew up on the animated Disney film, 'Sleeping Beauty,' so I flatter myself that I know the story pretty well. I was sceptical about how well dragging out the 'villian's' side of the tale would translate into a full length live-action movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.

For a start it had a big advantage with Angelia Jolie in the lead role. She does seem born to play the titular evil fairy, Maleficent. Obviously, the story does follow Sleeping Beauty for the most part and I actually got a little bored, technically just watching a live-action version of the classic fairytale. However, when it changes, it changes.

I won't go into too much detail, but the film-makers use a fair amount of creative liberties to stray from the story we know so well. Let's just say if you think you know the story, then you'll probably be surprised by what transpired.

Of course it's not perfect, but then my main gripes came from the excessive use of computer-generated scenery. I always get a bee in my bonnet when I watch a fantasy film (think Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, or Oz: The Great and the Powerful). I think I'm too old to allow myself to let go and just enjoy the story. All I can see is *technically* Playstation 3 graphics talking on screen next to the odd real actor or actress. Plus the three 'good' fairies just looked weird (in my humble opinion).

But the film does its job at breathing new life into an old (and well-known) tale. It should be enjoyed mainly by children, but it shouldn't be beyond finding its way into the hearts of adults, too.",
119,g-bodyl,8,Sleeping Beauty Revisited!,"Maleficent may not be the best fantasy movie from recent years, but it still is a good watch. It's a movie that continues the trend of turning Disney classics into live-action films and I welcome that as long as we get quality films. This film features good CGI and I liked the overall tone of the story. Speaking of which, I kind of enjoyed how they changed Maleficent from a cold-blooded villain to an anti-hero misguided by betrayal. Aside from the occasional narrative stumble, I thought this was a really enjoyable film.

Robert Stromberg's film is about a pure-hearted fairy who falls in love with a man, but he ultimately betrays her. In spite of anger, Maleficent curses the man's daughter. But as the years fly by, she realizes that this girl, Princess Aurora may hold the key to peace between her fantastical kingdom and the king's kingdom.

The performances here are very good. Angelina Jolie delivers a magnetic performance as Maleficent. Despite her not being labeled as evil, Jolie still manages to deliver some intense, angry scenes that are very mesmerizing. Elle Fanning manages to deliver a good performance, although she seems to smile a bit too much. Sharlto Copley made a good antagonist. Not overly evil, just a heart of stone.

Overall, Maleficent was a fun movie to watch for many reasons. The main reason has to be Jolie's stunning performance. The story itself hits a few roadblocks at times, but I feel that it doesn't necessarily matter. Taking away those annoying fairies would have done those problems justice. Mostly, I was pleased about how the movie turned out and kudos to Disney for making high-quality live-action remakes.",
120,A_Different_Drummer,8,Watch the Disney Studio give a clinic in movie making...,"While it may be hard for younger readers to imagine, the Disney Studio has not always been God-like, there were times when it seemed they had exhausted their creativity.

That was then. This is now. An influx of talent, inspiration, and a few well-chosen corporate takeovers have put Disney back at the top of the heap. And this film is not merely entertainment but a flexing of those corporate muscles, especially after the worldwide success of Frozen.

Note the quiet arrogance in re-imagining a story which the studio itself had made archetypal. Try pulling that off in film class.

And if they don't create an Oscar category for best cheekbones, they should. Many actresses in Hollywood will tell you that they could look that good with prosthetics. They lie. To look that good you have to START with the best face in Hollywood.

In deference to critics, the second Act of the film simply does not maintain the wonder and innovation of the start; and Elle Fanning, a future actress of great promise, seems slightly lost in an under-written part.

Still, this film is a major achievement and destined to delight children for generations to come.",
121,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,7,Ok-ish,"I watched for Jolie.

She did great job.

The movie was ok-ish.",
122,cosmo_tiger,7,This was better then I was expecting but did take something away from the history of her. After watching this she isn't as scary,"""The story is not quite as you were told and I should know. For I was the one they called Sleeping Beauty."" Maleficent (Jolie) is a fairy that is loved be everyone in the Moor. When she stops a human from stealing from her land she thinks she has found a friend and her true-love. Little by little he begins to show up less and less. After an unsuccessful attack by the king on Maleficent's forest the King offers to name whoever can take her down as his successor. When he tricks her in order to take the throne Maleficent is bent on revenge, she aims her hatred at the one thing the new King cherishes most, his new daughter, Aurora (Fanning). I'll start with the one question everyone will have, this is not a straight kids movie like Sleeping Beauty was but it is also not as dark and adult as Snow White and the Huntsman. That said I thought it was better then I was expecting but my 11 year old daughter loved it. The only real problem with this movie is the same problem that caused the Star Wars movies to lose some of the magic. Maleficent is arguably the Darth Vader of the Disney Villains, I think of her as the darkest and most powerful of all of them. When the prequels came out and you saw his origin it took some of the mystique away and he no longer had the aura he had before. This one had the same effect, I don't want to give anything away but you will see what I mean when you watch it. Overall, a movie that is geared toward young teens but isn't terrible for adults. I give this a B.",
123,atlasmb,7,A Fairy Queen's Story,"""Maleficent"" has a simple story, based upon the original tale and the earlier Disney animated feature ""Sleeping Beauty"". But this film is less about the story and more about the telling.

And what a telling. With amazing visuals (aided by plenty of CGI), ""Maleficent"" takes the viewer into a lush wonderland that consists of two parts: a kingdom ruled by a bellicose king, and ""The Moors""--a land of natural beauty, populated by fairies and all other manner of non-humans, who live a happy life under the protection of Maleficent, a beautiful young woman whose greatest passion is soaring through and above The Moors with her wonderful wings.

The use of rich colors and varying degrees of light and dark provides for the changing tones of the film, mostly due to Maleficent's changing perspectives on life.

Angelina Jolie, as the older Maleficent--aided by strong makeup, wardrobe and virtual facial appliances--is a strong presence throughout the film. Much like ""Wicked"", the viewer sees a different side of the story, where the title character is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light and not as an evil caricature like most myths.

I enjoyed this novel view of the classic Disney story, richly envisioned and realized.",
124,jacobjohntaylor1,7,Really scary.,This is a very scary movie. it is has a great story line. It also has great acting. If you were scared be A Nightmare on elm street or The silence of the lambs this is going scary you out of your mind.,

126,leonblackwood,7,Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10," I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney movie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once Aurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain, this movie really did have every aspect covered and I'm not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!

Round-Up: Angelina Jolie really doesn't make that many movies anymore, but when she comes out of the woodwork, she really does come out with some good movies. From Changeling to the action packed Wanted, she really does have a versatile acting ethic and with all of her charitable work and her hectic family life, I'm not surprised that making movies is low down on her priority list. I liked the chemistry between her character and Sam Riley, who played the crow, and the action scenes were very well thought out by the director. Personally, I don't think that it's a movie for the young ones because there are some scenes that will give them nightmares, but there are some scenes they will enjoy, like her magical land and the amazing creatures. In all, I'm surprised that I enjoyed the movie because I really wasn't expecting something so dark.",
127,Movie_Muse_Reviews,7,Visually delightful twisted fairy tale that plays to its strengths,"Disney's latest trend remaking its animated classics with live action and special effects meets the ""untold story"" motif in ""Maleficent,"" a spin on ""Sleeping Beauty"" from the villains' perspective. With traces of ""Wicked"" in the story and Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" in the visuals among other aspects, ""Maleficent"" has some excellent fantasy characteristics, and by carefully playing to its strengths, results in a sufficiently captivating film.

Everything about ""Maleficent"" starts and ends with Angelina Jolie. Ask the average person some Disney trivia and they probably wouldn't be able to tell you who Maleficent is. The only reason the film received $180 million and a go-ahead was because one of Hollywood's biggest stars had the eyes and cheekbones to pull it off and she said yes. Turns out Jolie has more than the obvious traits to make Maleficent into a sinister and sassy anti-hero. Every little catchphrase she delivers is the acting equivalent of taking a perfect bite out of a juicy apple.

Written by Disney live-action ""Alice"" scribe Linda Woolverton and directed by ""Alice"" production designer Robert Stromberg, ""Maleficent"" feels very much cut from that film's cloth, only it's a little more straightforward and less boring. At a tastefully merciful 97 minutes long, there's an understanding that this is just supposed to be a clever twist on a fairy tale and not the next big Disney franchise.

Stromberg's visuals are as impressive as his resume would suggest, having won Oscars in art direction two years in a row for ""Alice"" and ""Avatar."" The world of fairies doesn't play an integral role in ""Maleficent,"" but when the film does take us there, it's something to marvel at. Given these visuals exist for the sake of being beautiful, not because they serve a greater purpose, it speaks highly to the art team of ""Maleficent"" that they distract from the narrative blah of the film.

The problem with ""Maleficent"" is that its premise is far more interesting than the actual plot. Woolverton twists the classic story of ""Sleeping Beauty"" to make Maleficent so totally misunderstood and in doing so shakes up the traditional and often gendered archetypes of fairy tales. That's how the film hooks the audience, not with riveting suspense over how it will all play out.

In a nutshell, Maleficent was a kind and beautiful winged fairy, and a human boy, named Stefan, being as human boys are, stole her heart and betrayed her so he could become king. So when King Stefan (Sharlto Copley) and the queen give birth to Princess Aurora, Maleficent's curse on the curl is much deserved pay-back. And as it turns out, as Aurora (Elle Fanning) comes of age, Maleficent isn't simply hiding in the shadows.

On one hand, there's something frustrating about how narratively, ""Maleficent"" is about two adults who can't talk about their feelings and instead wage war against one another, but on the other, watching the film is like diving quickly into a beautifully drawn picture book that reinterprets a classic story. There's a nice message about true love in there too that really makes the whole concept a worthy exercise. No one will call ""Maleficent"" an excellent film in anything but its production value, but it should enjoy a long life as a visually fun and delightfully campy fairy tale twist.",
128,lisafordeay,7,I enjoyed this version of Sleeping Beauty(some spoilers ahead),"Yesterday I went to the cinemas 6/6/14 to see the new live action movie based on the 1959 animated fairy-tale Sleeping Beauty(which I also bought on DVD yesterday what coincidence eh)that deals with the villain in the movie Maleficent(played by Angelina Jolie sporting a British Accent like the time she was Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider movies,who knew Maleficent or any of the charcthers from Sleeping Beauty were UK accents its kinda weird why as I thought Sleeping Beauty was based in Denmark?).

Anyway back on to the review Maleficent is a fairy with beautiful eagle like wings and horns on her head who falls in love with a handsome human boy named Stefan. But when Stefan got older and his dad the king was dying and wanted someone to take over, but before anyone could take the kings place they must kill Maleficent first,Stefan decides to destroy Maleficent by cutting off her wings using chains. Heartbroken,Maleficent swores on revenge and finds out that Stefan's wife had a baby daughter according to her shape-shifting crow who she transforms into a man as she says that he will be her wings and she interrupts the ceremony and puts a wicked curse on the baby girl where she will fall asleep on her 16th birthday by pricking a spinning wheel with her finger and the only way to be awakened is by true kiss.

So Aurora(played by We Bought a Zoo's Elle Fanning who is Dakota Fanning's younger sister)is now living at a nearby cottage with her 3 fairies who turned themselves into peasant women, and every night Maleficent would sneak in and see her from the time she was a baby till she was 16,and also play misfit with Aurora's 3 fairies. But when Aurora meets Maleficent she thinks she is her Fairy Godmother; but is Maleficent really that bad/evil??. Of course Aurora later meets a prince called Phillip and she takes a shine to him,but when the curse is already set upon can Phillip's true love's kiss break the spell or someone else??

Overall I really enjoyed this movie as its got a very surprising twist to it similar to Disney's overrated masterpiece Frozen with Elsa and Anna where they don't need a man to break the curse. To be honest I think this film was sorta trying to be Frozen especially where (if you seen the movie),their kiss worked on Aurora and I was surprised by it. Angelina Jolie was brilliant as Maleficent sporting horns and wings and a PVC suit and a British accent. As well as starring in this movie,,her daughter Vivienne Jolie Pitt makes a cameo as Aurora as a toddler where she meets Maleficent and plays with her horns,as Maleficent says to her I don't like children,and Angelina was the Executive Producer for this film too. It was her movie and she did a fantastic job as the villain in Sleeping Beauty,but you do see a soft side to her character.",
129,gwnightscream,7,"""Good Fantasy Re-Imagining!""","Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning and Sharlto Copley star in this 2014 fantasy re-imagining of the 1959 Walt Disney classic, ""Sleeping Beauty."" Jolie plays the title role and this story is a bit different in which she starts out as a sweet, young fairy who shares a friendship with a young man, Stefan. Soon, she becomes wicked and full of hate after he takes her wings and sets out to become heir to the king's throne. She vows to get revenge by placing a curse on his newborn daughter, Aurora on her 16th birthday. Maleficent watches Aurora grow up as a sweet, innocent girl and may not be so bad when she starts to grow close to her and tries breaking the curse. Fanning plays Aurora at 16 and Copley plays Stefan as an adult. Jolie gives a great performance and looks exactly like the original character. James Newton Howard's score is also great as usual and I recommend this good fantasy.",
130,dfranzen70,7,"Deep, dark, and delicious","One day a Disney exec wondered out loud about what would happen if they remade one of their classic animated films but told from the villain's point of view. His yes men thought it was a great idea, until one of them pointed out that if the villain was the main character, they'd have to find a way to make him or her more appealing, someone the kids could root for, rather than against. And that leads us to Maleficent, in which the baddie from Sleeping Beauty is not a simple conduit of pure evil but a glad fairy wronged by by a human lover who perseveres despite her negative nature.

For those of you not up on your Disney, Maleficent was the wicked fairy who placed a curse on the infant Aurora, the daughter of the king who'd once held Maleficent's heart. The curse stated that on her sixteenth birthday, Aurora would be pricked by a spindle of a spinning wheel and then fall into a deep slumber that could only be broken by true love's kiss. Much of that plot structure is intact here, but we get to witness it all through the eyes of the fairy herself, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie).

At the story's outset, Maleficent is a winged fairy at one with the land and her ethereal companions. She laughs, they laugh. She protects them from harm, they laugh. It's all very symbiotic. And then one day a young boy wanders into the moors that the fairies call home - a boy named Stefan. They laugh a lot together, too, and they become close friends over the years. Then, as a young man, Stefan hopes to be named successor to the king whose realm surrounds the moors (a king who is dying thanks to the injuries inflicted upon him by Maleficient after his army attacked); the king says that whoever can defeat Maleficient for him will be the new ruler. So, despite the many years of laughter and love, Stefan decides to betray Maleficent, and that's when stuff gets truly deliciously dark.

For kids who saw the '59 animated movie, Maleficent was indeed a forbidding character but still manageable thanks to the cartoon nature of the film. Jolie's Maleficent is a little more terrifying. I don't know if kids today are just more jaded, but I think if I were eight years old I'd find this particular evil fairy the stuff nightmares are made of. Maleficent has large horns emerging from the top of her head, deep-red lipstick, and wicked, wicked eyes. She's not one to be trifled with. She also has what your English teacher might describe as ""verve."" Or maybe you would, if you're British or pretentious, or both. Anyway, grown-up Maleficent not only wields very powerful magic, she's defiant, defensive, and scheming. Add to that the fact that she's been spurned, and you have a perfect storm for a whole lot of revenge being dished out.

Now, in contrast to Sleeping Beauty, in which we witnessed Aurora's adventures through the prism of three bumbling (but well-intentioned) pixies, this trip is more about character growth. Look, it's a Disney film, so good things are probably going to carry the day. But it's not as if the well-known fairy tale is being treated as gospel, either. Because of the shift in perspective, some tropes common to Disney animated films are tweaked just a tad.

Jolie is amazing in a dominating (naturally) performance. Elle Fanning, as the teenaged Aurora, is fine in an understated (and understandably underwritten) role. Sharlto Copely plays Stefan, who transforms from a kind romantic to a caricature of Howard Hughes by the time the denouement arrives. (He's still pretty good, though.) But Jolie is the only actor who matters here, and this is a tour de force for her. It's a fun, intense role for her, and she doesn't dilute her character's ferocity by vamping. The visual effects, though, help mask the fact that this is a one-woman show. All of this adds up to a really well done live-action reimagining of a Disney classic, which is not a phrase one would have expected to type even five years ago.",
131,stevendbeard,7,Different Look at Disney Villain,"I saw ""Maleficent"", starring Angelina Jolie-Salt_the sequel is in the works_, Lara Croft:Tomb Raider; Elle Fanning-We Bought a Zoo, Super 8, Oh yeah, she is Dakota's younger sister and Sharlto Copley-The A- Team_2010, District 9.

It's been 55 years since the original Disney Sleeping Beauty was released, back in 1959. This is not a remake of that classic film, but it is based on it. It goes more into the early history of the characters. As the film starts, Maleficent is a child who is a fairy with horns on her head and big wings on her back. She is a good person, both to other fairies and creatures of the forest and even to nature itself. Then, she meets, falls in love with and gets betrayed by a normal human and things turn dark. Angelina plays Maleficent as an adult and Sharlto plays the grown up betrayer, who is now a king. Elle plays Sharlto's daughter, the girl who is to become sleeping beauty. The effects are pretty good, as well as the acting. The only thing is that it may be a little too scary for smaller kids; I saw several people with young kids in my theater that seemed a little frightened during certain scenes. Lana Del Rey sings Once Upon a Dream for the main theme song of the movie. It was rated ""PG"" for violence and frightening images and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes. I enjoyed it and would probably buy it on Blu-Ray.",
132,iquine,7,Unique Spin on a Classic,"This magical fairy tale revolves around a bitter fairy, Maleficent, who's majestic wings were sliced from her back by a man who would become king if he killed her. Since those two were childhood friends, he couldn't bring himself to kill her. Yet Maleficent, in a furious rage, puts a curse on the new king's newborn daughter that'll will come true on her 16th birthday, which can only be removed by a kiss from a true love. As the little girl gets older Maleficent began to grow fond of her and tries to remove the curse but even she is unable. Oh No! ;-) Will a true love find her before her sweet 16 and if not, will she ever find true love? A typical fairy tale story but nonetheless, it is magically presented with sweeping special effects and solid acting. This type of role is well-suited for Jolie as her chiseled look is right on. This has a darker atmosphere than most of Disney's movies yet has enough creativity and quirky characters to entertain older children.",
133,r96sk,7,Cool to see a different telling of 'Sleeping Beauty',"Not as dark or deep as I was expecting/wanting, but it is cool to see a different telling of 'Sleeping Beauty'.

Angelina Jolie fits as the titular character, bringing with her a good performance. Elle Fanning (Aurora), Sharlto Copley (Stefan) and Sam Riley (Diaval) play their respective roles well enough, but neither come close to matching Jolie - as you'd probably expect.

I found the special effects a bit iffy. It's not that it looks anything close to bad, I just thought it could've looked better. The score isn't all that memorable, either. I did enjoy how the plot unfolds though, mainly thanks to the lead admittedly.

Intrigued to see what the sequel to 'Maleficent' has to offer.",
134,3xHCCH,7,Ironically Enchanting,"""Maleficent"" is about the evil horned witch we see condemn Princess Aurora to a grim irrevocable curse on her 16th birthday in the Disney classic animated film ""Sleeping Beauty."" Like the recent ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", this re-imagined fairy tale goes beyond the beloved story we know. In this case, it tells us the reason behind Maleficent's malevolent hate for humanity that caused her to issue such a miserable curse.

The popular trailer with all those quotable lines (""Well, well ..."" or ""Then you'll be afraid ..."") does not spoil anything. There is still so much to see and be enthralled about as the story unfolds from Maleficent's childhood until that fateful day of Aurora's Christening. You will definitely understand what made Maleficent deliver such a deadly curse.

But for me there was more ironic magic in what unfolds after that day, when Aurora was brought to live in the woods with the three small fairies, who were not how we know them as well. Even in the face of impending danger, the film manages to convey a sense of wonder and even awe. It does so without ever lapsing into over- sentimentality or being corny. For me, these scenes are a pure delight.

That is, until we reach that part when the sleeping Aurora gets wakened from her eternal sleep by the kiss of true love. What was supposed to be THE climactic moment of the film turned out to be a most anti-climactic disappointment. This scene was just so familiar, very reminiscent of another climactic moment in another recent big Disney hit.

Angelina Jolie looked like she was born for this role. Those exaggerated cheekbones actually suited her quite well. She captured the many layers of Maleficent's emotion and character in both big theatrical gestures, but more so in those small subtle facial or vocal inflections. I cannot imagine another actress other than Ms. Jolie in this role. That beautiful scene between Ms. Jolie and her real daughter Vivienne (as toddler Aurora) was divine beyond description.

Elle Fanning was a very pretty Aurora, with her disarming smile radiating her character's good nature and blithe spirit. Sam Riley also stood out as the human form of Maleficent's trusted crow, Diaval.

Sharlto Copley looked woefully miscast as King Stefan since he did not particularly look or act kingly at any point. Brenton Thwaites, the awkward young actor they chose to play Prince Philip, did not particularly look or act princely as well.

The three actresses who played the three little ""good"" fairies led by Imelda Staunton were not bad. However for me, they were only occasionally funny as sometimes their comedy could get corny. That they did not stick to the dear Flora, Fauna and Merriweather we know is also rather disconcerting.

The land of enchantment in the mysterious Moors, with its fairies and other fanciful creatures, was created as an unexpectedly delightful and happy dream world by the computer animation artists. The special visual effects which transformed Diaval into his various animal forms (including fire- breathing dragon) were also topnotch.

This film is best viewed with a blank slate, no expectations at all. The magic of this film is witnessing firsthand those unexpected twists and turns in the relationship between Maleficent and the other characters in the well- known tale.

Up to the point before Aurora goes back to the palace, I was very fascinated with the storytelling such that my rating was 9, or even 10. However the very weak and predictable climax significantly knocked a couple of stars off. But overall, it is still a film worth catching on the big screen. 7/10.",
135,peterp-450-298716,7,I believed in fairy tales again during 97 wonderful minutes.,"""Before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will fall into a sleep like death!""

The very first feature film I've seen(as far as I can remember)was the original Walt Disney film ""Snow White and the seven dwarfs"" when I was about 6 years.It was in such a tiny village cinema in the pre-smart phone era.You could actually enjoy a movie without the feeling that you were in some kind of nightclub with all these luminescent screens.That movie made quite an impact on me. Maybe that's when my love for the medium of film was created.Later in life, I read lots of books.Especially the fantasy genre appealed to me. A fantasy world as Terry Pratchett,Feist,Terry Goodkind and Tolkien (of course) described it.When reading a book about a mythological and magical world populated by dwarfs,giants,wizards and knights,I spent hours in this imaginary setting.The film industry also amused me with great movies like ""Willow"",""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Chronicles of Narnia."". Ashamed I have to admit that I was eager to see the first Harry Potter movie,as if I was still a teenager. And nowadays, being a father, I enjoy watching ""Frozen"" and old Walt Disney classics with my two kids. To make it short: I still love a fairy tale once and a while! ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" already appealed to me. The first one because of the beautiful SE's and the impressive giants.The second film because of the gang of funny dwarfs. Sad enough the expression on the face of Kristen Stewart was again of the same level as a typical pancake.That disappointed me a bit. And that's the most successful part of ""Maleficent"":.The wide range of expressions that Angelina Jolie demonstrates herein.No discussion.She was perfect for the role. That soft and sweet look while relaxing and during loving moments. The menacing, unyielding gaze during a confrontation. The devastating evil glance at the time she felt betrayed and hurt. Both facial expressions as body language are used by Jolie in a fantastic way. Those glittering eyes, those sharp cheekbones,the dominance and that demonic laughter. I never thought I would say this about Angelina Jolie,but this was really a beautiful rendition.

Everyone knows the story of ""Sleeping Beauty"", so it's a bit pointless to summarize it here. But if you assume that this is an ordinary film that doesn't deviate from the original story, then you are mistaken. This time they looked at it from a different angle. And I must admit that you can call it a fairly successful result. First of all the build-up to the story of ""Sleeping Beauty"" was magnificent. Although it looked more like the intro of ""Settlers"". It felt like a cartoon. That feeling goes away the moment you enter the Moors. A magical land adjacent to the human civilization, where only peace and happiness prevails, and one does not know or understand the human traits of greed and envy. A magical landscape populated by all sorts of wondrous characters, including the small (but powerful) fairy Maleficent who lives in a huge tree. That she eventually becomes the evil and vengeful witch because of underhanded treachery, is a very creative brain twisted idea that the filmmakers have used here. And the denouement differs somewhat from the original fairy tale. But I must admit that I found it extremely fascinating and unique.

About the parts being played I can be short and concise.There is only one masterful rendition in ""Maleficent"" and that's the one Jolie takes care of. The whole movie revolves around this character and (I can not say it enough) she did it masterfully and professionally. An engaging and friendly character at the beginning,who's determined to defend the Moors against the humans.And then transforming into a nasty, evil witch with a devilish smile.The most striking imaginative scenes were the battle at the Moors and the christening. Then you see her slowly transform into an understanding person with remorse. For once I felt sorry for the wicked person from a fairy tale and sympathised with her.

The other members of the cast were reduces to meaningless roles that were necessary for the story because of this acting by Madame Jolie. Elle Fanning did well as Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) but was really annoying after a while with her innocent giggling all the time. Sharlto Copley was convincing as the power-hungry King Stefan. And the three fairies, who were given the task to guard Aurora until her 16th birthday, didn't look great when they were still mini. But they took care of the humor side of the story. The only one who could make an impression next to A. Jolie, was Sam Riley as Diaval. But I guess the successful effects when he transformed into a horse or dragon again, had something to do with that.

And then there is the second very important part of this film : the special effects. These were at times overwhelmingly great. The landscape of the Moors, the creatures living there, the battle against the humans with the living trees (immediately reminded me of ""The Ents"" from TLOTR), the dragon and the flying skills of Maleficent herself. Breathtaking and simply beautiful. With a budget of roughly $ 200 million it ought to be. And Stromberg as a director also guarantees that. He knows the craft of visual effects, looking at his impressive resume on IMDb.

An entertaining movie with a masterful interpretation. Nothing negative to say then ? Oh yes, it's sometimes so blandly and predictable. Immediately you feel where it's going and how the denouement will be. It's not very original and the surprising twist is actually obvious. But it's a long time since I was immersed in a fairytale atmosphere like this and momentarily I forgot I had already passed that age where you still believed everything. I believed in it again during 97 wonderful minutes.

But, alongside of the appeal of having Jolie in the film, also the remixing of an old story is quite interesting. After all, the Disney animated version came out more than 50 years ago and while Once Upon a Time has featured Maleficent, it wasn't Angelina Jolie.",
137,ShelbyTMItchell,8,Disney Fans Will Love Humanized Tale!,"Angelina Jolie who has been taken a break from the big screen for up to three to four years. Comes back in a big way.

Meanwhile Stefan marries and have a daughter named Aurora, whom due to the fact of Stefan breaking her heart. Will curse the baby, But due to some begging, will not as the curse will have to be broken by something that you will have to see in the movie.

Begins to have a more love than less hate relationship with the young teenage girl as she grows and matures.

The ending will leave you really not wanting to go to the bathroom at all. As true love is not what you think in this movie as there is a twist to it.

138,rgkarim,8,"A New Take, A New Maleficent","It seems that Disney pumps out a new movie every month these days, as the studio releases yet another film. Instead of baseball throwing Indians though, this weekend's film revives an old tale in a new form. Yes, I'm talking about Disney's Maleficent, director Robert Stromberg's adaptation to the animated Sleeping Beauty. Did he fill the big shoes and hype the trailer's brought? Read on to find out

If you haven't been swept away by the cascade of trailers, this tale focuses on the dark fairy's origins and how she became so wicked. At least that is part of the story. Stromberg took some interesting steps in his rehash, putting enough spin on the tale to make it almost an entirely different story that is sure to bring mixed reviews. I myself rather enjoyed the tale, despite it's predictability, creating a character-centered story with emotion, passion, and a little bit of surprise while still bringing other elements into the tale.

Of course the main support of the movie is Angelina Jolie, who captured the villainess in both looks and spirit. Her natural beauty, combined with fantastic makeup and wardrobe, was accentuated in this film, ditching the green skin for a more natural look that radiated power. Jolie's beautiful eyes seemed to act on their own, mirroring the emotions trapped within the dark fairy. Even her voice sounded like Maleficent, grabbing the arrogant and malicious smoothness the cartoon made famous, though her screaming and moaning were a bit overdone. Jolie nailed the spectrum of emotions her part required, and had me fall in love with her acting all over again as well as have a different look on Maleficent. Of course I am a reviewer who likes his balance, and Maleficent fails to spread the acting weight around, relying on Jolie a little too much

The other cast in this movie were okay, their limited screen time just long enough to bring something to the movie. Sam Riley as Maleficent's raven Diablo er Diaval , was my second favorite of the cast. His character was a mini version of Maleficent; helping to keep the sorceress on her toes, while providing well timed comedic relief to keep the tale running. Elle Fanning brings cuteness and positivity, but doesn't add much more than that, often reduced to walking and smiling at the green screens around her. Sharlto Copley as King Stefan is an important character, but his overstretched accent, and acting made him a bit more humorous than what I think they intended.

However, the greatest thing about this movie for me is the world Stromberg and company created. Maleficent's design is gorgeous in all aspects, as the fictional kingdoms come to life in spectacular detail, that would look even better in 3-D. While the human kingdom is fitting, the true masterpiece is the Moors, as the mythical beasts and enchanted creatures come out in dazzling colors and light that fits the whimsical nature befitting fairy tales. The integration of nature into each creature, allowed for a variety of creatures to be seen in the movie, each mirroring their place in the hierarchy of Maleficent's kingdom. My particular favorites were the tree warriors, not just for the action they brought, but for the integration of cultures and movies in their design, though I'll admit they are a bit similar to the tree ents in Lord of the Rings.

Maleficent does have some weaknesses at hand. Some of the creatures were a bit too similar familiar characters we've seen in other films, the biggest being the fat elves that look like an overweight Dobby from Harry Potter. The pixie's were my biggest problem. Their design was a bit too fake, exaggerated, and sometimes very similar to what Smeagle would look like as a girl. On top of that, they were airheads that were meant to be funny, but were more annoying, very similar to a certain Star Wars character we all know. I think Stromberg made them the way that Maleficent saw them, but he just went a little too far for my tastes, luckily they aren't in most of the movie. As for the story, the twists are interesting and well needed, but at times I was a bit bored, wanting something else to happen instead of getting an eyeful of Maleficent stalking in the shadows. It seemed they fast-forwarded through some parts, focusing on the visuals and Jolie, more than the actual story. Of course I may have been a little close-minded at parts from my expectations of the film.

Maleficent took a different path, but there are so many good elements to this movie that make it worth a trip. Visually it is gorgeous, and Jolie brings so much to the part though it was at the cost of the other actors. Story wise it is fine, but try to go in with an open mind or you may be disappointed with Stromberg's approach. Is it worth the hype? For me it wasn't as good as the trailers made it out to be, but it was still good and emotionally fulfilling, despite some of the odd antics. I would say it is theater worthy to see.",
139,Seraphion,7,A good job on retelling of the classic children's tale,"At first, little Maleficent was a nice fairy. One day she meets Stefan, a human boy from the neighboring human kingdom. The acquaintance grows into a romance until they're adults. But then after his 16th birthday present to her, he doesn't go to meet her anymore. The Human King then sought to conquer the Moors, kingdom of the forest where Maleficent stands guard. She and her forest army managed to repel the attack and injure the King, but he survived because his iron armor wounds her. At his sickbed, the King ordered his men to avenge him by killing Maleficent. Stefan, who turns out to be one of the king's men, meets her in the forest at night, at first warning her of the King's order. But then he betrays her by cutting away her wings while she's asleep. Not long before she knows the truth of Stefan's betrayal and his reasons, and this turns Maleficent from a pure at heart into a vengeful being. Without her wings, but fueled with vengeance, her magic grows stronger. Not long, the new king and queen have a child and throws a grand celebration.

As in the tale, the wicked Maleficent came crashing at the celebration, giving the child Aurora a bad wish of eternal slumber on her 16th birthday, which can only be awakened by true love's kiss. Aurora is then kept hidden for 16 years by the good fairies while the king's men tries over and over to siege the Moors to no avail. Over the years Maleficent and her aid crow looks over her without the fairies knowing. At one point Maleficent lets herself be known to Aurora, and Aurora rekindles the love that was once in her. Maleficent tries to cancel her curse on her but fails. Aurora briefly meets Phillip. On the eve of her 16th birthday Aurora discovers the truth of Maleficent. She then goes to her father but the king locks her up in a room. Maleficent snatches the returning Phillip, knowing that he can be the answer for the curse. The curse manifests a spinning wheel and Aurora goes into sleep as her finger is punctured by the needle.

Maleficent sneaks into the castle carrying the fainted Phillip and deliver him to Aurora's room. The fairies encourage him to kiss Aurora, but she still sleeps after it. Maleficent, out of her regret kisses Aurora on his forehead, and that kiss awakens her. Maleficent and Aurora then go to see the king but the soldiers capture Maleficent with an iron net. She changes her crow into a dragon that saves her from the net. But the soldiers prepares iron tower shields and block her movement while the dragon is shackled with chains. Aurora slips into a room where her father keeps Maleficent's wings and breaks the cage. The wings fly back and merge back to Maleficent's body, strengthening her. She carries on with the fight and manages to exile the king with her alone on a top of a tower. She holds back her fatal blow but the king stabs her from behind. In retaliation she sort of throws him from the tower. Afetr the king's death, the two kingdoms are united and the story ends well.

The base story is an example of a creative retouch on an already well- known story. But instead of being a mere sequel, prequel, remake or reboot, Maleficent promises a fresh story by simple altering the perspective from which the original story is being told. And by having a different perspective, of course there are altered elements of the original story. Much like in a case with more than one witness, some witnesses will have differing elements to the same story.

The choice of cast is quite unique from my point of view. The main cast unite the senior Angelina Jolie with the newcomer Elle Fanning. Elle has a great deal on her hands, being to have a significant role in a big break to at least stand on the same standard as her sister Dakota. The supporting cast is filled with stars with remarkable acting capabilities but with relatively no significant role as yet, such as Sharlto Copley, Sam Riley and Imelda Staunton.

Yet with those cast of diverse blockbuster experience, the acting proves quite good. No doubt their theater experiences, and the basic setting and story mood that requires less of common-era behavior, helps to boost the perspective towards the acting.

The makeup department did a great job overall. Although for me, Maleficent's headdress slightly slipping over forward at the later parts is quite annoying. The music scoring is a great help in building the mood of the scenes, especially on the scenes of battle preparations, appearances and magics. The visual effects are done well giving us enough to live out the fantasy world of the Moors. Although I think that the visual effects is taking more emphasis it should have.

From me, Meleficent (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see. It's a good family movie to spend time with.",
140,raulfaust,8,Karma Chameleon,"Since some good friends invited me, I went to the cinema to check this picture, knowing nothing about it-- except that Angelina Jolie would be in it. I'm not a fan of animations, and I haven't ever heard about Maleficent's story, but I really enjoyed this movie. Angelina Jolie plays a fairy that due to bad circumstances of her life, becomes relatively mean. The good point that this movie tries to show is that people aren't a hundred percent good or bad. It depends on a lot of circumstances that sometimes are not up to us. In this case, spectator can't distinguish who is the villain. Both main characters have their motivations and do what they feel like doing when the feelings come up. And that's a good thing, considering that children movies used to expose the manicheaist idea of ""good vs. bad"". Also, the special effects are AWESOME, and so is the directing, delivering a professional characterization. The story becomes very cartoonish once Maleficent goes mad and invades the castle to spell the curse. If I was a child, I would surely be scared in that scene. The real love thought is also interesting, being another mark for the genre, along with ""Frozen"". All in all, ""Maleficent"" is a GREAT picture that sets another mark for the genre, and may inspire a lot of other stories from now on.",
141,Kamurai25,7,"""A Second Side of Darkness""","Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I'm not a big Angelina Jolie (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") fan, but she definitely nailed the part, and I felt for her when those things happened, so I'm definitely not going to say she's not a good actor.

Elle Fanning (""The Great"") is great, mostly an annoyingly happy little thing while she's awake, alongside wonderful supporting cast and gorgeous (and sometimes goofy) CG animated creatures.

Disney definitely poured money into this to make it look great. They also spent quite the effort to revitalize the story. After rewatching ""Sleeping Beauty"" and some other variations (I did fail to reread the original story), I am definitely a fan of the direction they took. The original story was just so weak and empty, and this does one of my favorite things and humanizes a villain into an adversery into of an evil monster.

I'm not a fan of how or why the 3 faeries get involved, but it makes some sense. And I'm very happy with how they handled the resolution of the curse.

They created this awesome world which adds to the movie in a very special way.",

Too mean and cruel in several ways and there are not enough words to describe the whole scary movie in detail. It opens all sweet and beautiful. A 5-year-old fairy queen with oversized dark wings and horrendous horns fails in love with Prince Stephen. She grows up hating him, as he spurns her for a human princess and the power of the kingdom, like a medieval Darth Vader. She turns the cute little gnomes into cute little trolls. Creates matchstick men out of dead trees and becomes a genuinely ""Gloomy Glenda"". So predictable that I couldn't sit through the middle of the DVD. I resumed it when she ""cursed"" little Princess Aurora. The 3 good fairies then hide her in the woods for 15 years. Several twists and turns here. She befriends ""Aurora"" and has to reverse her own curse after the teenage girl finds a room of broken spinning wheels. She is drawn to them like a magnet. Maleficent breaks her own curse by kissing Aurora, who she now loves like her own daughter. King Stephan is driven mad and someone else becomes the dragon. Several knights become dragon-toast and Aurora becomes the human queen who unites with the fairy Queendom, overseen by the ""new"" Maleficent. (Yes, Aurora finally gets her ""Prince""). Maleficent flies off into the sunset (really) with her winged sidekick and everybody (left alive) lives happily ever after. Dakota Fanning's sister ""Elle"" is so young and adorable as ""Sleeping Beauty"". Angelina Jolie plays ""Maleficent"" magnificently. The sexiest fairy with creepy giant wings and horns that you have ever seen! Should be rated PG-13. This will give really little kids nightmares for years! Just as ""Pinocchio"" (the 1950's re-release) bothered me for years: cigar smoking ""Lampwick"" ""morphs"" into a donkey and Pinocchio ""dies"" briefly after being swallowed by ""Monstro"" the Whale. Such sweet little ""Disneyfied"" Fairy Tales!",
143,Terryfan,7,Maleficent has it moments,"Now I have heard a lot about Maleficent who was the main antagonist of Sleepy Beauty. This film however centers around Maleficent.

Angelina Jolie's performance in the movie is very well crafted and that she is actually a fan of Maleficent make her performance that most impressive. She did all she could to look like Maleficent.

Elle Fanning plays Aurora and she did what she could in the film. Sharlto Copley plays Stefan and his character you have to watch what he does.

The film really present itself with a lot of visuals and powerful effects that are impressive that you have to watch to appreciate. Disney didn't hold anything back on the effects and it is very well crafted.

But where I feel the film really feels strange is that the story has been change so much from Sleepy Beauty that you are going to be throw so many curve-balls that you will not believe it

Now I know this is a movie about Maleficent it just the whole plot can feel out of place. Also some of the other characters can be annoying.

The main thing that makes the film is Jolie's performance and the visual that is what droves the film.

I'm not saying I hate the film it just there is a lot of mix results for me.

But I do recommend it if you're a fan of the characters and this is one Disney film that you might want to check out",
144,cricket30,8,Spinning wheels don't hurt people . . .,"people hurt people. Many of us have forgotten to stand up for our Second Revision Rights: ""Our Ruler will make no law to prevent us from bearing and spinning wool."" It doesn't matter how many pixies go on needle-cursing rampages, the Disney Conglomerate reminds us in MALEFICENT. Regardless, Big Government has NO RIGHT to confiscate the personal spinning wheels of its citizens just because a few bad apples misuse them to harm society. We MUST retain our full God-given rights to spin anywhere AND at any time AT ALL COSTS! Only a crazy dictator would try to gather up and destroy all a nation's wheels, in order to keep the entire population from spinning. If spinning is outlawed, only outlaws will be able to spin! Or, to paraphrase Charlton Heston, the only way the jack-booted thugs will take away our spinning wheels is to pry them out of our cold, dead hands! People get killed in America's prisons every day with spoons. Are they going to take away our spoons, too?! How will we eat our soup and ice cream then? Disney gets it right: Keep your hands off our spinning wheels, Big Brother!",
145,ketgup83,7,Maleficent is magnificent,"Fantasy movies have their own charm and story with spellbinding visual effects and interesting creatures. Lord of the Rings series , Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter etc have entertained the audience all over the world. Maleficent is true attempt to the genre.

After getting betrayed in love, a witch curses an infant who is supposed to bring peace and harmony to the troubled land.

First time director Robert Stromberg, who worked previously as Visual Effects supervisor does a fabulous job in keeping the audience alive. The story is similar to the fairy tale "" Sleeping Beauty"" which has been tweaked little for good. Art direction is mesmerizing. Cinematography is brilliant. Background score is soothing. Editing is perfect. Screenplay does falls short of being excellent but smooths well keeping you entertained. It is Angelina Jolie who is the captain of the ship. You have loved her as hard- hitting female fatale in previous films, you will admire her work as ""evil-turned-good"" witch.",
146,muamba_eats_toast,8,Great fun,Enchanting visually and emotionally a great performance all round and fun for all the family. A little to cheesy for me at some times but to be expected with a Disney film I suppose.,
147,bob-the-movie-man,7,An effective children's film that could instill movie wonder in younger audiences,"I'm always a sucker for a good story, and you have to admit that – at their hearts – some of the fairy tales are corkers. Sleeping Beauty is a case in point. Tension, narrative drive, good vs evil and – thanks to writers Jack Lawrence and Sammy Fain – a gloriously memorable Disney song in ""Once upon a dream"".

The new Disney reimagining of the fable – Maleficent – takes some liberties with the story in serving up a star vehicle for Angelina Jolie, who was also an executive producer on the picture. In the story, we see the young and carefree Maleficent, strongest of the fairies in the magical land of ""The Moors"", corrupted by the greed and avarice of man who inhabit the neighbouring kingdom. Betrayed and mutilated by Stefan – the man who would be king – a vengeful Maleficent places the famous curse upon Stefan's daughter who is grows up in the care of the bickering red, blue and green fairies as featured in the animated version, here played by Imelda Staunton, Leslie Manville and Juno Temple.

Maleficent is aided and abetted in her evil plans by henchman come crow come wolf Diaval, played by Sam Riley (so good in ""Brighton Rock"", but here looking all the world like UK jazz star Jamie Cullum).

Angelina Jolie's beauty is evident, but it is a strange and angular beauty and just perfect for this role. In fact it is difficult to imagine any other actress that could play this. You might imagine the role to be fairly two-dimensional, but the twist given to the story allows some significant range for Jolie to explore, and she does it very well.

The evil and deranged Stefan is played by Sharlto Copley – continuing his bad-guy roles following ""District 9″ and ""Elysium"".

Elle Fanning, younger sister of Dakota and so effective in Super 8, plays the teenage Aurora, in a suitably smiley, sweet and totally asexual Disney manner. Perhaps its just me, but at times I think she has a striking resemblance to a young Drew Barrymore. A particular star of the show is the baby that plays the young Aurora: if this kid grows up to be a film star this footage will feature strongly in ""Before they were famous"". Also worthy of note is the five year old Aurora played by Jolie's real life daughter Vivienne. The scenes are quite special, in the manner of a ""what the hell are you doing wearing those big horns on your head Mummy?"".

I was first attracted to this film in part due to the gorgeously spooky rendition of ""One upon a Dream"" played over the trailer. And we hear it in full over the end titles. I'm embarrassed that it took me until the titles to realise it was Lana Del Rey – of course it is!! The rest of the score, by James Newton Howard, is suitably orchestral and supports the drama well.

The special effects are excellent, from the imagining of the mystical land of the Moors to the effective fire-breathing dragon in chains, so feared by generations of kids under the Disneyland Paris castle.

This is fundamentally a kids film. But it is a good kids film, and if you took a sensitive five or six year old to see this they might be infected with the wonder and love of cinema that followed my inoculation by Mary Poppins at a similar age. And whilst there is mild peril to alarm kids, there are none of the emotional plot jolts that infect some similar films like Bridge to Terabithia (which this has some similarities with): it certainly has a much lower traumatisation quotient compared to that shocker! Where the film lacks something is in the crossover to a potential adult audience. Cute baby aside, there are not a lot of laughs in this which is an opportunity missed. There is a lot of very plodding dialogue all on a very one-dimensional plane and I feel that having a sparky writer of the likes of a Jane Goldman, to add a layer of adult humour 'above the heads' of the junior audience, would have spiced the recipe up significantly.",
148, Movie-Misfit,8,The Avatar of Disney Princesses!,"I was quite hesitant on seeing Disney's live adaptation of this old tale. I mean, do we really need more of the same from the studio that constantly rehashes old work?

The kids had already seen it and quite enjoyed it, but my husband wanted to check it out, and with both of us not being huge fans of Jolie, I must admit that we did go in with low expectations.

But within the opening 5 minutes, we were immediately hooked and bombarded with some of the most incredible visuals I've ever seen on film!

As the film progressed, we were sucked in to a beautiful tale that had some new elements which only carried the slightest sprinkle of Hollywood cheese, so as not to put you off.

Jolie was very good in the role, and by the end of it, we were both left sitting with huge smiles on our faces. Even the kids enjoyed it a second time!",
149,ersinkdotcom,8,Maleficent' tells another side of the 'Sleeping Beauty' fairy tale,"""Fractured Fairy Tales"" used to be a comical segment on ""The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show."" Nowadays, they're serious movie-making, TV, and book business opportunities that have inspired films like ""Snow White and the Woodsman,"" ""Mirror, Mirror,"" ""Jack the Giant Slayer,"" ""Enchanted,"" and primetime hits ""Grimm"" and ""Once Upon a Time."" Let's not forget to mention bestselling graphic novel series ""Fables"" and all its spin-offs and companion pieces. Disney's ""Maleficent"" is the latest entry in this new line of re-tooled legends.

Once a beautiful fairy living in the magical outskirts of a great kingdom, Maleficent's life is forever changed when she's betrayed by the human she loves in his quest to become the ruler of the great land. In a fit of rage and jealousy, she curses the King's newborn baby to fall into a deep sleep on her sixteenth birthday with only the touch of true love's kiss to break the spell. She grows to regret the curse as she witnesses the girl growing up. Is there a way she can take back the spell or will the girl find true love in time to save her?

Imagine everything you know about ""Sleeping Beauty"" being turned on its head. Some children (of all ages) might feel like they've been living a lie by the time the credits roll on ""Maleficent."" One thing I can tell you for sure is you're guaranteed a good time along the way. The story gets a little weighed down with drama in some parts, but overall there's enough action and special effects to nudge you back to consciousness right when you're eyelids start to get heavy.

Angelina Jolie proves she was the right choice to bring the tragic character of Maleficent to life. She revels in the delicious havoc she wrecks on screen, while also emoting the remorse she feels as she oversees Aurora grow into a young woman. She fully embodies the part in her physical look and emotional demeanor on screen.

All sorts of CGI creatures and creations fill ""Maleficent."" Most of them look completely believable and blend well with all the practical sets and actors. There are points where the limitations stand out more so than others, but nothing too distracting.

""Maleficent"" is rated PG for sequences of fantasy action and violence, including frightening images. Things might be a bit too dark for the younger girls who love Disney's animated ""Sleeping Beauty."" Tree monsters and hedges of giant thorn bushes smashing soldiers might scar them for life.",
150,bigverybadtom,8,"Retelling Of The ""Sleeping Beauty"" Legend That Is Too Scary For The Kiddiewinks","There are people here who are disappointed that this movie has no resemblance to the animated movie from decades ago...but that is presumably the intended idea. The movie is certainly scary and violent without being gory, but definitely don't take little kids to see this one. It will be quite unsuited for them.

Maleficent begins life as an immature fairy in a beautiful, harmonious fairy world next to a conventional and harsh kingdom. She is visited by Stefan, a boy of a similar age from the kingdom, who implies that someday he will live in the king's castle. An innocent romance begins, but soon ends as the boy grows older, and the current ruler of the kingdom attempts to invade the fairy world with his army to steal its treasures, only to fail. As the old king is dying, Stefan claims the throne by amputating and stealing the fairy's wings. He gets the crown, marries, and has a baby daughter...only for the now-embittered and vengeful Maleficent to arrive and place a curse on the daughter. Stefan is forced to have his daughter raised by three fairies to try to keep her safe...and in the process, becomes embittered and vengeful himself. But over the years, as the daughter grows up, unaware of what had happened, Maleficent sees her and starts having second thoughts. But the cold war has started between Maleficent and Stefan; can Maleficent undo the damage she has done?

Like most characters in recent fairy tale-themed movies, nobody is entirely good or evil, and everyone is the victim of the attitudes of their respective cultures and eras. Good for teenagers or above, but too upsetting for the young kids.",
151,mfellipecampos,8,Very good,"The plot revolves around 'Sleeping beauty' from the point of view of the Malevolent fairy who, betrayed, is blinded by hatred and a feeling of revenge. The film can entertain two types of audiences, both children and those who have seen the 1959 animation in the past. The story is reimagined under the events of the Brothers Grimm story. Angelina was able to clearly demonstrate the feelings portrayed in Maleficent. His features, screams, looks, laughter, everything was magnificently touching. Watching this film is like discovering the great mystery behind the character's story. The new art brings a new look at Maleficent, King Stefan, Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, the Diaval raven. The story tries to show a world that no one has ever seen, as Angelina Jolie said. The film's plot revolves around a beautiful and naive fairy with penetrating black spoiler wings: Maleficent leads a life of peace in the kingdoms of the Moors, having grown up in this peaceful kingdom; until one day, the humans, seeing the rise of the Moors, decide to exterminate them, threatening the harmony of the region. Maleficent is portrayed, at the same time, as villain and heroine, she being the real Sleeping Beauty, for having her beautiful personality asleep and forgotten in the midst of these new feelings of revenge, bringing an anti-heroine role. The great innovation of 'Maleficent' was the story being told from a point of view that until then was unknown, even giving us several moral lessons, such as being careful with the thirst for revenge, because we can regret it later. spoiler: The film is also innovative in portraying other forms of love, not being attached to the classic imposition of love Eros, between two people of opposite sexes, a characteristic present in the classic Disney fairytale animations. The film is directed by Robert Stromberg, a specialist in visual effects, who left the audience gaping with the effects in 'Maleficent' as well as in 'Alice in Wonderland' or 'Avatar', winning the Oscar for his better work as an art director in these films. The soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard was also magnificent, epic, and related well with the environment of the film. As for the script, written by Linda Woolverton, it is touching, exciting, impressive and lively. The way of portraying events that were not revealed in 'Sleeping beauty' was perfect. The question of '' Why did she cast the curse? '' Has never been well explained, and made us see Maleficent as just a bad, hate-filled witch. However, in this overproduction of Stromberg, the way she was wronged and wants her revenge is revealed from beginning to end.",
152,ThomasDrufke,5,Sleeping Viewer,"It tends to be a theme now-in-days to retell a story through the 
villains perspective. Maleficent being the latest, grabbed Angelina 
Jolie to star as the so called 'anti-hero'. She is magnificent. She 
really brings this sexy femme fatale vibe to the film and gives probably
 the only worthy performance to the picture.

Let me preface this 
by saying I have yet to see Sleeping Beauty so take my opinions with a 
grain of salt, but I really don't think this is a very good film. I was 
very intrigued as to the way they would treat the lead character, with 
it being a villain per say. But in reality she is just the misunderstood
 one and the king is the true villain here. It just seemed too by the 
numbers for something that was supposed to be all about changing what we
 already believe. There were many things that made absolutely no sense. 
First, they don't explain why Stefan ever left Maleficent when they were
 young in the first place? And it doesn't make too much sense why Stefan
 would send Aurora away under the protection of the 3 fairies when he 
could easily do the same thing but in the castle. If he would only do a 
better job burning the wheels, because burning wooden wheels is so 
difficult right? 

The film looks impressive and is darker than 
most Disney films, but in all it's just not too much fun. There is 
plenty to look at but the characters don't feel relatable because 
everyone besides Jolie, just seems like they are acting. Sharlto Copley,
 who is usually great, seemed like he took the paycheck and walked 
through this role. There just wasn't much too this film. I appreciate 
what the film was going for, I just don't think the outcome is worth an 
admission price.

153,lesleyharris30,5,"Fails to Dazzle or Bring the Story to Life,","Maleficent is a mediocre movie with mostly poor story development, 
albeit a terrific cast. The highlight is, without any doubt, Angelina 
Jolie's dedicated performance, she lives the motivations of this 
character and brings her to life in a way that every other aspect of 
this movie failed to do. The development of the story is a major 
disappointment, failing to bring us what was meant to be the Wicked 
equivalent of Sleeping Beauty, but we never truly understand her 
aspirations. The tone was also very uneven, it stretched from dark, Tim 
Burton like moments, to very light, whimsical parts with cute, lovable 
CGI creatures, I could not help but wonder how much better this could 
have been if Burton had directed it, he would have set up the tone 
perfectly and this type of story is right up his alley. Failing to 
deliver the promise of its premise, Maleficent falls flat on so many 
occasions that a short ninety minute run time manages to feel like a 
drag. 

A vengeful fairy puts a curse on a new born princess in which she will remain unconscious until she discovers true loves kiss. 

Best Performance: Angelina Jolie",
154,tomgillespie2002,5,"Good-looking nonsense, but it's nice to have an interesting female lead in a mainstream film","Anyone who has seen Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959) will no doubt 
remember the horned wicked sorceress that is Maleficent. She appears 
only briefly, but her extremely dark persona and complete lack of 
empathy make her a memorable and intriguing Disney villain. Maleficent 
the film continues the trend of allowing female fairytale antagonists to
 tell their side of the story, as well as Hollywood's desire to re-make 
every film ever made that was ever a success. Disney is sitting on a 
treasure-trove of beloved stories, all ripe for 're- imagination' and 
money-making. But, cynicism aside, Maleficent is actually not that bad, 
thanks mainly to a purring performance by Angelina Jolie as the titular 
witch.

Opening in the CGI-heavy world of the Moors, we meet a 
young girl with mighty wings. She is Maleficent, the fairy-queen who is 
one with the strange-but-lovable beasties and natural kingdom all around
 her, which borders the land of men. She meets a young man named Stefan,
 and the two becomes friends and eventually fall in love. As they grow 
older, Stefan stops visiting the Moors, and when he becomes an adult 
(Sharlto Copley), begins to work for the greedy King Henry (Kenneth 
Cranham). Henry, terrified of Maleficent's magical power, declares war, 
only to be beaten back by Maleficent and her army of tree creatures.

On
 his death-bed, the King announces that whoever kills her will become 
his heir. Stefan, befriending Maleficent, tricks her into drinking a 
sleeping potion and, unable to kill her, cuts off her wings and brings 
them to his king. Years later, with Stefan now king and announcing the 
birth of his daughter, Aurora, Maleficent gets her vengeance by 
gate-crashing the party and cursing the child with the dreaded spinning 
wheel spell, promising release only by true love's kiss, something she 
knows not to exist. As Aurora is cared for in the woods, Maleficent 
watches closely, and sees Aurora (Elle Fanning) grow into a person 
capable of uniting the two lands.

Directed by visual effects 
artist Robert Stromberg (who won Oscars for his Art Design on Avatar 
(2009) and Alice in Wonderland (2010)), Maleficent has spectacular 
special effects, but the world it takes place in feels almost entirely 
soulless and fails to capture the magic created by those using a pencil 
55 years ago. The story often goes to dark places, but it's difficult to
 care about the characters that inhabit the film, who aren't allowed to 
develop any extra dimensions other than the ones they were given in 
Disney's original vision. However, Maleficent, in the hands of Jolie, 
dominates the film as expected. She manages to juggle the understandable
 darkness brewing inside of her character as well as the humane, caring 
side. The film may be good-looking nonsense, but it's nice to have an 
interesting, morally grey female lead in a mainstream film for once.

155,DarkVulcan29,5,Up there with OZ The Great and Powerful,"A retelling of the classic Disney film Sleeping Beauty not a bad idea, 
although I never really saw that film, a film from the villains point of
 view could of had interesting twist too it.

Now the effects are 
the only good thing here, but the acting really brings things down. 
Angeline Jolie is sleepwalking through the role has Maleficent, but 
there is one scene she does give a good performance, but other than that
 she looks like she'd rather be doing something else. The other parts 
bring nothing to the table, the ones playing the three fairies are 
trying to be like a female three stooges but the more they try the more 
they are not funny.

For fans, you'll probably enjoy the old Sleeping Beauty.",
156,billygoat1071,5,Sympathy of the Villain,"Maleficent is ought to tell the backstory of one of Disney's most 
formidable villains. Definitely, there might be a dark truth about an 
innocent outcast transformed into the monster the villain is now 
famously known for. There could be a possible inspirations from famous 
tragedies into the drama. Meanwhile, when you somehow realize the fact 
that the person behind this project is only known for special effects, 
indeed you'll get the best looking blockbuster you'll see this year. 
Unfortunately, that wasn't supposed to be the key merit of this story. 
Maleficent suffers for the lack of gumption of portraying true darkness 
and depth that this tale calls for, which results a disappointing 
origins of the classic villain.

Telling a backstory of a villain 
doesn't always have to be tricky, one I could suggest is a Shakespeare 
inspired tragedy type of storytelling, because apparently that is what 
perfectly fits to their themes, but the film rather focuses on the 
aesthetics. The story itself is about sympathizing the villain, like 
pointing them as the real victim of the world's darkness because of the 
people's lack of tolerance in their strangeness. This idea is obvious 
for sure, but it all falls short by the script's lack of real depth. It 
doesn't really have any interest at developing much of its characters, 
especially when it comes to relationships. Princess Aurora's friendship 
with her supposedly enemy is nothing more than an exposition to their 
world and admiration to its beautiful creatures. There is no genuine 
emotional impact and it hurts a lot of elements. While betrayal and 
threat are the vital point of the story, the shallowness of the film 
refuses to make them feel like they're a big deal.

So really, it 
could have focused a lot more on the characters and only let the 
narrator talk in the intro and the epilogue. The film surely has enough 
time to linger on the characters. Instead, it lingers more on how 
beautiful everything in this world looks. We shouldn't blame at the 
director's fascination with his own skill, in fact it is the only thing 
that brings it to life. The effects are indeed eye candy, the production
 and costumes are totally rich, and the cinematography could be 
perfectly use for something iconic. But again, this is not what the 
movie generally asks for. The visuals could have worked better in a 
superhero movie or any fantasy that is mainly about action, but a story 
like this should always be at the heart of the drama and not of the 
action or landscapes.

The performance at least beats the 
contrivance. Angelina Jolie, as expected, shines as Maleficent. Though 
there's only one scene that will totally amaze the audience which also 
had already been seen in Sleeping Beauty. But overall she brings the 
soul of the character thus makes this Maleficent really effective. The 
other cast doesn't do much. Elle Fanning is undeniably charming as 
Princess Aurora. Too bad, manifesting her innocence is the only thing 
the script can make her do. Manville, Stauton, and Temple are mostly use
 for comic relief, and it becomes so broad, the fairies end up becoming 
like a female version of The Three Stooges.

Maleficent has plenty
 of great technical achievements and solid acting, but the problem 
really is its lack of darkness. Aesthetically, it is dark, but 
thematically and emotionally, this is where it becomes underwhelming. It
 makes the 1959 Sleeping Beauty movie looks darker and will scare 
children more than this supposedly grim prequel. So the main message is 
basically Maleficent's evilness is actually just an illusion that is 
made up by the ones who have a problem of accepting people who are 
different. Well, that is just one of them. All of its messaging could 
have worked better if the characters and their interactions to each 
other are also well developed. Still, these things doesn't even justify 
on what makes this villain so compelling. Overall, it's neither bad nor 
good, it's just not the movie Maleficent deserves to be.",
157,James_De_Bello,5,5/10,"5/10 Definitely not a solid entry in the Disney slot this year, but it 
has its moments. From a visual point of view the movie is a mess: there 
is no balance between CGI and the (few) practical effects. More than 
half of it is shot on a green screen and it just shows in the final 
product. There is nothing tangible or real everything is just a mass of 
digital effects thrown at you that simply continue, throughout the 
movie, taking you out of it. The transitions between the aerial-digital 
shots or the introductory shots and the real sequences is flat out weird
 and makes for a very uncomfortable watch at times. Moreover there are 
some shots and sequences that are copied unashamedly from the Lord of 
the Rings and instead of making for a pleasant throw-back they simply 
come out as cheap. In the mist of all this digital mass of weirdness 
there is some practicality that is used, but comes off as strange 
because of this visual incoherence. On the flip side, except for a 
couple of scenes, the effects are actually well rendered, yet simply 
overused, but the moments in which the movie manages to deliver are in 
the majority visual and when they are well directed they actually make 
for a very entertaining time that unfortunately is quickly stopped by 
the return to the actor in front of a green screen. A shout out has to 
be given to James Newton Howard for his wonderful score: it frequently 
managed to elevate all of the on screen material and make you much more 
interested in the drama, if it hadn't been there I guess I would have 
been bored through all of it. Despite there being close to zero 
character depth on the general scope and a screenplay that doesn't 
manage to do anything mildly enthralling other than a sweet dynamic 
which works thanks to the actors, Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning bring 
an amazing amount of charisma to the screen that made me surprisingly 
entertained. Yet on a performance level, other than some subtlety from 
Jolie, there isn't much going on and here it's the director that clearly
 takes the blame, because despite managing to put together 100 minutes 
of messy fun he clearly does not have a grip on narrative, character 
development and actor direction, all of this resulting in some very dull
 or cheesy moments. Nevetheless I will credit the movie for making me 
interested in parts of it and actually entertained by some dynamics, yet
 on the whole I simply wasn't into it for all of the above reasons and 
will probably forget most of it sooner rather than later.",
158,chappywatched,5,Chappy Watched: Maleficent,"Maleficent isn't a sequel, a prequel, a remake or even a retelling but 
Maleficent's story before, during and after Aurora's infamous finger 
prick.

I didn't mind this movie, though there were some points were it was a bit crappy.

The
 costume was amazing but I didn't really like the mega-defined 
cheekbones (reminds me of Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' album cover).

There
 are points in the movie were the colours and moods are bright, vibrant 
and colourful and then others dark, it also looks like a great majority 
of the movie has been green screened when they could have easily done 
location shots, which I think always takes something away from any film.

Rather
 than Maleficent being evil like in Sleeping Beauty, you start to feel 
sorry for her and you actually start to hate King Stefan in this film.

I
 love the Disney's Sleeping Beauty and especially the 3 fairy godmothers
 but in this film, I couldn't stand them. In Sleeping Beauty they are 
happy and playfully banter with each other while in Maleficent, their 
'playful' banter at most points is actually mean and there doesn't seem 
to be any fondness towards each other.

It was on okay film. Worth a watch at least once or twice but I probably wouldn't own it.",
159,thepriceofpayne,5,Not my Malificent,"Despite some great performances from Angelina Jolie and Sharlato Copley 
(as well as Brenton Thwaites and Elle Fanning) Malificent is sadly a 
butchering of the classic Disney villain by giving us the she was good 
all along twist that is played out and fairly lame. The CGI is also 
awkward and the tone of the film drifts from whimsical to dark to 
nurturing and it's hard to keep up. All in all the film isn't terrible 
just not what it could've been and not a what made Malificent herself in
 the first place.",
160,aldri-feb,5,Weak version of Sleeping Beauty's tale,"It takes big task to create a movie about evil character which 
unfortunately ""Maleficent"" doesn't pass it. While the movie was too busy
 to exploit generosity of Maleficent, the studio seems forgets some 
details in it. They just leave the origin story of ""Sleeping Beauty"", 
used the products and manipulated whatever they want so that makes 
""Maleficent"" more like another version rather than the untold story of 
""Sleeping Beauty"". Maleficent who used to be a scary-dark-fairy at tale,
 turns into weak personality and sometimes becomes a hero. The writer 
seems too lazy making character development and prefer pick someone else
 to be blamed as villain. Robert Stromberg who makes his directorial 
debut deeply confused with some elements the film have. Though Angelina 
Jolie's form is undeniably incredible and shines as Maleficent and 
visual effects are neatly produced, still they couldn't much save this 
movie from being disappointing. After ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Oz: the 
Great and Powerful"" and ""Maleficent"" fails to impress, I think Disney 
should move on from making live-action on popular tale which main 
purpose only for collecting profit.",
161,michael-sengwah,5,Too Predictable Twisted Plot,"Disney thinks that to recycle the twisted plot idea just as in Frozen 
might work well for another time in this long lasting childhood fantasy,
 but it is a huge disappointment considering that the secret has already
 revealed from the beginning of the film. The lazy style of telling the 
story through narration, putting too much attention on unnecessary parts
 but neglecting the main root of the story and weak scores are the three
 major drawbacks. The tale of sleeping beauty can venture into a more 
darker experience but the intention just to target family audiences has 
made the film overall a huge let down. However, the magnificent 
performance from Angelina Jolie is extremely awesome as she is able to 
manage well the different immediate moods change of her character 
throughout the whole film.",
162,dramafreak42,5,Powerful Set Up that Loses Steam,"It's amazing how many 1 or 10 star reviews there seem to be. Clearly a 
polarizing film. And as is so often the case, the truth lies somewhere 
in the middle.

There's a bold and daring revisionist film in 
here, but it becomes more and more muddled as the story progresses. The 
first 30 minutes or so devotes itself to a single mission: making the 
actions we've seen Maleficent take in the original ""Sleeping Beauty"" 
appear to be fully justified. And you know what? It works. With a new 
back story linking her to Aurora's father, this has suddenly become a 
female empowerment revenge story, almost akin to a high fantasy take on 
""Kill Bill."" Unfortunately once it crosses over into the events of the 
animated version we already know, things start to go awry. If the film 
had the guts to stick with how it started, and justify Maleficent but 
keep her just as harsh as we've always known her, then it could have 
truly been something incredible. The problem is that approach ultimately
 wouldn't be family friendly, and this is Disney after all. So we end up
 with bonding between Maleficent and Aurora and a continuing softening 
of Maleficent as a character. This might have worked if the film hadn't 
succeeded so well in justifying the evil version early on. It tries to 
have it both ways: ""She totally had a good reason for being so bad... 
but wait, she also wasn't as bad as you thought!"" It's this attempt at a
 middle ground that robs the film of its initial power and leaves it 
feeling like the watered down version of a decent idea. For her part, 
Jolie really owns this role and is without a doubt the best thing that 
the film has going for it. The rest of the cast is serviceable, but the 
characters aside from Maleficent haven't been given much more dimension 
than they had in animated form (some even made more one dimensional in 
some cases.) The use of CGI is excessive, but at the same time the shots
 are beautifully composed so it kind of balances out.

In the end,
 if this was going to be done somebody other than Disney should have 
done it. This really needed to be done by somebody who didn't care about
 tainting a family friendly legacy, because it's that fear that feels 
like it holds the film back from what it otherwise might have been. It's
 not bad by any stretch, but it feels fundamentally compromised at its 
core.",
163,kevinthecritic,5,"""Maleficent"" is Not Magnificent, But Worth Seeing","2.5 out of 5 stars (decent)

Disney has been around for a long 
time, bringing us animated classics like Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, 
and Tarzan. Of course, those films were in the 1990s, the ""Disney 
Renaissance,"" a time when Disney could do no wrong. Disney's newest 
trick has been to re-tell its classic animated films with a darker 
touch, as well as in live action, since live action appeals to a larger 
audience. In 2010, Disney teamed with director Tim Burton to present a 
re-tooled Alice in Wonderland, which, while a financial success (so much
 so that a sequel is in the works), was not a critical hit. Maleficent 
will likely follow the same path as Alice, but I liked Maleficent more. 
Maleficent is a dark (for Disney), sometimes funny fantasy telling the 
Sleeping Beauty story from the point of view of its villainess, 
Maleficent. Is it a new Disney classic? No, but it is entertaining.

In
 this interpretation, Maleficent (played devilishly well by Angelina 
Jolie) was once a good fairy who became close friends with a human, 
young Stefan (Sharlto Copley of District 9). Their relationship 
blossomed through adolescence, when the war between humans and fairies 
reignited, forcing their lives down separate paths. As they matured, 
each became a leader in their kingdoms. They met again when the aging 
human king offered his throne to whoever vanquished Maleficent. Stefan 
betrayed both Maleficent and the king, leaving her alive, but bitter, 
while he ascended to the throne.

Years later, Maleficent has a 
chance for revenge when she learns that Stefan is christening his baby 
daughter, Aurora (played as a teen by Elle Fanning). Maleficent crashes 
the affair, cursing her to ""fall into a sleep-like state!"" on her 16th 
birthday when she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. (It's as if 
Disney is afraid to use the word ""die"" nowadays.) Furious, Stefan tells 
his guards to burn every spinning wheel and sends Aurora to live in 
seclusion with three fairies (Lesley Manville, Juno Temple, and the 
extremely underused Imelda Staunton), who wouldn't look out of place on 
one of those never-ending Real Housewives TV shows. Since none of these 
three imbeciles possess the means to properly raise a child, Maleficent 
is forced to play fairy godmother in order to keep the child alive long 
enough to meet her demise. The relationships between all the players of 
this game change and twist as the child grows.

Maleficent has 
many good qualities. Angelina Jolie is a fantastic choice for the role, 
giving it her all, as always. The cinematography and visuals are 
astounding, and the action scenes are exciting. The computer-generated 
creatures are entertaining without resorting to crude jokes or bathroom 
humor. If the film is nominated for anything, it will be in the effects 
category.

Sadly, other parts of the movie are not as well done. 
Sharlto Copley is extremely miscast and completely unbelievable as a 
ruler of this beautiful land, there to yell for the entirety of his time
 on screen. Elle Fanning plays the role with a little more ditziness 
than I would have liked, but at least she's not one of those teenagers 
who are full of angst. No Bella Swan complex here. The three fairies are
 some of the most annoying creatures ever to come out of a Disney movie.
 While their brief bickering was funny in the original, here it makes 
you want to kill them, and not in a love-to-hate way.

It was very
 hard for me to tell the age group for which this film was designed. It 
has Jolie, who treats the role with the seriousness it deserves, but no 
adult with half of their brain cells working will find the fairies 
funny. Also, the prince that Aurora is supposed to fall in love with is a
 huge throwaway character, only there for a couple of awkwardly scripted
 scenes. The script is the biggest problem. It switches from good, 
moderately dark scenes to ""funny"" ones to calm the kids down. The kids 
in our theater were not scared by this at all. The opening and the 
climax mirror the previews for the film, but the middle needed some 
re-writes. No offense to Linda Woolverton (who also wrote Alice in 
Wonderland) but she should seriously consider finding a writing partner.
 So far, her writing career has consisted of extremely high-concept 
ideas that end up being half-baked. All in all, Maleficent is worth 
seeing and an interesting take on the story, but don't expect anything 
magical.

While I can say that I still enjoyed it. I have a serious thing about 
movies that make things too ""convenient"" you'll learn what I mean if you
 choose to go see it. The story was flat, but the visuals were 
excellent. I'm just sad that I chose not to see it in 3D. It is 
completely possible to find onesself asleep during this flick as the

inevitable conclusion. Anyone who doesn't see it coming should be

165,sum123,5,An empathy-jerking alternative story of Satan,"Does anyone realize that this is an alternative (false) story for 
Satan's history with God? It is an excellent piece of fiction, and 
superbly produced and well-acted. But the embedded message is laden with
 blasphemy (or simply subtle mockery of the entity that some people know
 as God), and sympathy with the entity that some people know as Satan 
and empathy with Satan's claims about God.

Angelina Jolie represents Satan. I leave the rest for smart people to decipher and recognize.

By
 the way, these comments have nothing to do with a specific religion and
 the writer is not even a Christian. Even an atheist who heard the few 
stories told about what happened between God and Satan can still 
understand what I'm talking about, and in the end, all versions can be 
fiction to him or her; understanding that this is a ""version of Satan's 
story"", an alternative version to empathize with the entity, is enough.",
166,romessanadeem,5,"Maleficent: Part-time Prankster, Full-time Babysitter","I didn't really hear a whole lot of good things about Maleficent and so I
 didn't bother watching it for quite a long time. But I figured, it's 
Angelina Jolie, there's going to be a dragon (seeing as how it's a 
remake of Sleeping Beauty) and it was 12 am on a Monday and I needed to 
watch something short but entertaining. 

The very first thing I 
noticed right off the bat in the beginning of the film i.e. the fact 
that the movie, for lack of a better word, is childish. There's ""I am 
Groot"" like creatures and odd toad like mini ogres, swamps and marshes 
that apparently smell like unicorn glitter and sunshine, seeing as how 
there's other creatures living quite contently in it. The whole scene 
initially of Angelina Jolie flying about the magical land was 
reminiscent of something I watched in a Tinkerbell movie as a child.

The
 movie proceeds to tell, or rather to retell, Maleficent's story. One 
thing leads to another, Angelina Jolie loses something precious to her 
after a boy she loves betrays her in order to become king, getting us 
back on track to the story we grew up with, when she shows up at the 
King's daughter's birth to curse her. The King sends the girl, Aurora, 
away to live in the depths of the forest (which is in no way 
problematic) with three incompetent pixies. Somewhere along the way, we 
also find out that iron burns fairies. Well, if that's true Maleficent 
should disintegrate into bits by the irony of her situation.

Turns
 out, the Kings decision to have three retarded pixies taking care of 
his child is generally a poor life choice as they let an infant child 
cry, scream and starve. And so, (surprise surprise) an unlikely bond 
begins to form between Aurora and Maleficent as she begins to take care 
of her. Aurora grows to be an unnaturally chirpy girl and ends up 
trusting just about everyone and everything, whether it be a woman with 
horns growing out of her head or an opposite sex person with whom she 
should really know nothing about. 

Another thing I couldn't help 
but notice was that the editing was far from great. It wasn't anything 
in particular, but telling enough for me to have made that conclusion. 

Moreover
 some things in the movie were just poorly executed; Maleficent's abrupt
 domination and the woodland creatures sudden subservience, the dragon 
transformation, the stab at doing the whole imitation of a popular 
recent animated Disney film, and last but not least, the gloriously 
villainous Maleficent's transformation into part-time prankster and 
full-time babysitter.

In conclusion, Maleficent does carry some 
visual and dramatic impact, Angelina Jolie looks magnificent and some 
viewers may find the retelling of the classic charming and intriguing. 
It does, after all, have tremendous potential, imaginative and creative 
imagery, and in an ideal world, it should have been a mix between ""Pan's
 Labyrinth"" and ""Alice in Wonderland."" Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie's 
eyebrows seem better crafted than this movie itself.",
167,Cconfehr,5,"Beautiful costumes, scenes and a fresh look at Sleeping Beauty.","The movie was beautiful, Angleina Jolie's cheekbones are magnificent, 
her horns are envy worthy and I am really enjoying how Disney is 
starting to show the Villains side of the story. Oh and not to mention 
Maleficent's leather outfit at the end. I mean... If anything is a ""must
 see"" in the movie, it is that outfit.

Maleficent is about a 
fairy (named Maleficent) who, as a child, meets a human boy (Stefan). 
They spend a lot of time together while growing up and learn to trust 
each other. When Stefan is grown, he stops coming to visit her. The next
 time he sees her is in a battle, years later, when the corrupt King 
tries to invade the beautiful land that she and the rest of the magical 
creatures live in. During the battle, Maleficent defeats the King and 
before he dies he claims ""Whoever kills Maleficent will be my 
successor."" Well, Stefan  knows he can regain her trust and kill her to 
become King.  He then drugs her and attempts to kill her but cannot. His
 solution to still be the Kings successor? Take her wings from her and 
offer them to the King.

So from there, they fight. And this is 
where the story of Sleeping Beauty comes in. Idk - it was good, the 
interactions between Aurora and Maleficent are funny and sweet. But it 
felt very rushed and almost too ""Disney"". There's a really intense scene
 where Maleficent is choking someone and there is a really long pause 
for effect and she says ""IT'S. OVER."" Now, I would typically expect some
 sort of profanity or a stronger line than that, but that's what they 
went with. So.

Oh. And the crow is hilarious. 

Moral of the story: don't cast a spell that ""nothing on earth can break"" and there's always two sides to a story.

If
 you like Disney, go see it. If there are other movies you want to see 
(Chef, 22 Jump Street, How to Train Your Dragon 2, A million Ways to Die
 in the West, Million Dollar Arm, Jersey Boys, Neighbors, Blended, 
Spider Man, The Other Woman...) Go see that instead.",
168,radulovicka,5,Great expectations...,"As a true Disney child, I used to watch Sleeping Beauty over and over 
again, till I knew all the lines and all the songs by heart. It remains 
one of my favorite cartoons of all time. Having said that, I had high 
expectations from Maleficent. I was disappointed. As a prequel to the 
original story, we were expecting some major alterations to take place, 
in accordance with contemporary mass Hollywood agenda of lightweight 
storytelling, resulting in huge summer box office success and even 
bigger revenues from popcorn sales. Let me start of by saying how 
plastic-y and CGI-heavy the visuals were. Even by fairytale standards, 
they were absolutely unrealistic and unconvincing, as was pretty much 
everything else in the movie. Character development was almost 
non-existent, despite a few twists which were to be anticipated mere 
seconds before they were revealed on screen, leaving the atmosphere of 
utter discontent and ultimately posing a question ""Who is supposed to be
 the target audience?"". For example, King Stefan and the three fairy 
godmothers were so naively and superficially depicted that it almost 
reached a point of absurd. They were by far the biggest disappointment. 
Casting Jolie as Maleficent proved to be a good choice from the visual 
point of view - she is stunning, but her acting wasn't so pleasing. 
Fanning's Aurora is sweet and innocent and it would've been a delight to
 have more of her on-screen presence, but only if it was followed by a 
decent plot. With the original Sleeping Beauty you knew what to expect -
 it's a cartoon, so it must be for children, right? But even so, the 
cartoon is still a masterpiece, cleverly and charmingly combining the 
everyday goofiness of the characters together with the ultimate evil, 
followed by a classic true love theme, and lastly an amazing soundtrack,
 making it a joyful experience for viewers of any age. In my opinion, 
not only does ""Maleficent"" lack charisma, but is also insecure about its
 genre, making it an in-between-type-of-movie - not entirely for 
children nor the adults. I pains me to see that a story with such 
potential for serious re-interpretation is diluted down to a mediocre 
and worn out tale of war between good and evil, when in fact it could 
have been a masterpiece. If only Hollywood would grew a pair...",

Maleficent
 is for all those Angelina Jolie lovers. She is pretty much the movie. 
Don't get me wrong, she does a good job. Besides a few corny lines here 
and there it's an OK movie. Special effects are easy on the eyes. I 
thought the 3 fairies were a wonderful addition and probably had the 
most 'Disney' feel throughout.

The story is bland however. A 
twist on the original; still unsure if this spoilt it. Maleficent didn't
 seem evil enough which is a shame as Jolie looked set. The make-up is 
unique and mysterious. It works and fit's the character perfectly. A 
more devious plot would have been welcomed I think.

This movie is
 very much like a lovey dovey fairytale and I doubt that's what folks 
were expecting. Disney can also do wicked but I feel it's too weak in 
this movie. An opportunity lost for such an iconic villain.",

bad. Parts of it are exquisite – the wings scene with Angelina Jolie is 
breathtaking but the fairies drove me nuts and the CGI went from clearly
 real to clearly unreal. I thought the producers could have done such a 
better job with this. The King who had previously starred in District 9 
was laughable with his Scottish accent. So, so disappointed. It is not

On a brighter note, King Stefan's voice was hilarious, but I am not sure they made that on purpose.

Good
 performance from Angelina Jolie, no denying that, but both hers and 
Elle Fanning's screenplay felt very already-seen-that-twenty-times like.

I'm
 fine with the reimagining of the classic villain. The story works hard 
to make her the aggrieved party. The movie looks good. Angelina Jolie 
looks good but she's very monotone. It feels a bit lifeless. Maleficent 
just isn't the appealing character that a movie needs to build around. 
It starts at the childhood stage. The two kids need to have more fun. I 
understand the need to get to Jolie as quick as possible but their 
childhood is nothing more than a weak montage. I like the true love's

bad points in this movie.",
175,Prismark10,6,A Fairy from the Moors,"I liked this reworking of the Sleeping Beauty tale by Disney as they 
focus on Maleficent the malevolent fairy in Sleeping Beauty,

Here
 Jolie's powerful fairy has been betrayed by a boyhood human friend and 
she curses the baby princess more out of anger and wanting revenge for 
the loss of her wings.

However as the King for some reasons after
 the curse abandons the baby princess to three inept fairies its up to 
Maleficent to keep the baby safe from a distance which includes making 
sure she is fed.

The screenplay and story is not without 
problems, in fact its heavily flawed and might perturb younger viewers. 
The parents give the child to the three fairies who are clueless in 
raising a baby and seem to be criminally negligent which ceases to be 
funny.

The humans are shown to be power hungry out to destroy the
 fairy world with Sharlto Copley's King being an uneven villain himself.
 He betrays Maleficent for his desire for power and Copley's accent is a
 cross between South African, Nordic and Scots.

Its a light film 
with great sets and costume design, a flawed fantasy with a strong 
performance from Angelina Jolie who lifts the film and makes it better 
than it has any right to be.",
176,lee_eisenberg,6,new fairy,"Robert Stromberg's ""Maleficent"" is an alternate telling of the Sleeping 
Beauty story, turning the supposedly evil character into a sympathetic 
one. Angelina Jolie depicts the title character as a strong woman 
defending her realm from the humans, all of whom come across as ruthless
 jerks (just look at what Stefan does to acquire the throne). It does 
seem as though humans ruin things everywhere they go.

It's not 
any great movie, but I like what they did with the character. It's a 
basic tenet of storytelling that a character has to go through changes, 
and Maleficent goes through many over the course of the movie (and not 
just physically). I recommend the movie as a different look at the who 
Disney princess genre. Could it be that everything that we've known 
about these stories has been a lie? Worth seeing.",
177,utgard14,6,Enjoyable Enough Despite Flaws,"Yet another reimagining of a classic fantasy story with the goal of 
adding layers to some of the characters, specifically the villains. It's
 the latest trend I guess. I wasn't exactly rushing to see this because I
 figured with that formula it would be pretty by-the-numbers. For the 
most part, I was right. You can telegraph most of what happens in this 
movie fairly quickly. The one big surprise being the betrayal of 
Maleficent early on. This took me by surprise, particularly the 
brutality of it.

I must admit to not liking a lot of the CGI. I 
was shocked at how poor some of it was. Pretty much every scene 
involving a fantasy creature that takes place in daylight is very 
obviously fake, cartoonishly so. The three little fairies with the faces
 of the actresses superimposed on the cartoon bodies is the worst. Now, 
perhaps I'm just an old fogey who misses the point, but shouldn't the 
goal of CGI be to blend the real with the make-believe as seamlessly as 
possible? Maybe they should spend the time to build the sets and 
costumes and work on old-school make-up techniques if this is the best 
they can do. As you might expect, the effects are better for scenes that
 take place at night. Seems like that's always the case.

Anyway, 
my gripes about the CGI and the predictability of the story aside, I was
 entertained. It is well-acted and enjoyable. It helps if you haven't 
seen a lot of these types of fairy tale reworkings in recent years so 
maybe you won't feel a little burnt out on them. It helps even more if 
you aren't a fan of the older stories so you don't feel like movies like
 this are giving your childhood favorites the middle finger.",

A decent adaptation of the Sleeping Beauty fairy 
tale, mixed with another Brothers Grimm tale. Interesting story. In 
typical made- for-children fashion, however, plot is sometimes quite 
random, and not entirely watertight. 

On the other hand, and 
oddly for a Disney movie, it is not your usual all happiness-and-light. 
The movie is fairly dark, which is good. (Though not sure that will play
 with the targeted child audience though).

Good performance by Angelina Jolie in the lead role. She brings the suitable edginess and darkness. 

Good support from Elle Fanning. Shalto Copley seems a bit miscast as the villain. 

Cast also includes Hannah New, of Black Sails fame. A pity she gets very little screen time and hardly any dialogue.",
179,lasttimeisaw,6,a sounding welcome for Angelina Jolie,"A quite long absence from big screen, since THE TOURIST (2010, 7/10), 
Angelina Jolie is back with this unorthodox adaption of Grimm Brothers 
Sleeping Beauty fairytale, parades her overpowering belligerence and 
devilish look, retells the story from the angle of the villain 
Maleficent, an evil fairy (with two giant horns) who puts the sleeping 
spell on princess Aurora (Fanning) in order to pay back to her father 
King Stefan (Copley) for his brutal betrayal. 

Indubitably, one 
crucial prerequisite of the movie's success pivots on Jolie's personal 
attributes, her majestic empress aura amalgamates with the distinctive 
malevolence set the keystone of the story, which is ecstatically 
bewitching, her slightest facial expression and even the most common 
utterance entice the viewers into an oblivion of her-costars and a 
thorough submission to her realm of prestige. 

First-time 
director Stromberg is a credentialed wonderland architect, (won two 
Oscars for AVATAR 2009, 9/10 and ALICE IN WONDERLAND 2010, 6/10), in 
this film, the virtual dichotomy of two worlds looks derivative and the 
epic-ness of the story is lacking, while, firmly leans on a 
family-friendly doctrine, it borrows from FROZEN (2013, 8/10) for the 
concept of a bigger love, true love should never be hamstrung within the
 boundary of princess-and-prince banality, it transcends beyond gender, 
age and race, it is a cutting-edge message unyieldingly transmitted from
 Disneyland presently. 

Elle Fanning and the 
Manville-Staunton-Temple trinity of fairies (Flittle, Knotgrass and 
Thistletwit) bring breezes of joyfulness and it is axiomatically 
impossible for us to be immune from cute babies, let alone one of the 
young Aurora played by Jolie's real-life daughter, who contributes the 
most adorable scene in the picture. Copley is typecast in his demented 
ruggedness, his side of struggle maybe too dark to expound to younger 
audience, and Riley as the crow Diaval, finds an unlikely allegiance 
with Maleficent, whereas Thwaites, plays Prince Phillip, is a handsome 
pawn and completely throwaway. 

In a nutshell, MALEFICENT is an 
enthusiastic welcome vehicle of our goddess Jolie in a fantasy world, a 
befitting role for her to testify her star power and further lure us 
closer to her distanced and mysterious charisma.",
180,MLDinTN,6,"great visual effects, but the story has its faults","This movie was OK, but the main fault with it was predictability. You 
knew from the start, the young boy, was going to turn selfish, that 
Maleficent would want revenge, and that whom would be required to give 
true love's kiss. Bringing the Prince into the picture did not add any 
suspense because you knew that he wasn't true love's kiss.

But 
the special effects were very good, from the flying of Maleficent into 
the clouds, to the living trees, the growing black trees. Truly amazing.
 Also, I loved Angelina Jolie's makeup. The pale face and contour with 
the red lip looked so good and just make her look like a villain.

who does a very satisfying job in this film. Unfortunately, Elle Fanning
 is a totally superficial Sleeping Beauty. She is a pretty silly face 
that appears because it has to appear. But the blame may be on the 
script rather than the actress. In fact, the script tells an interesting
 story and is generally good (especially if we realize from the 
beginning that the film is a reinvention of Charles Perrault's short 
story) but it also presents ideas and situations that we just can not 
swallow, like the initial attack on the Maleficent kingdom, with an 
entire army in line for battle against an enchanted forest. The Roman 
emperor Nero (or Caligula?) did something similar when he wanted to 
conquer the ocean and dominate the god Neptune, but we know he was 
crazy... The movie has several situations that our logic simply does not
 accept, even with the excuse of magic. Stromberg, the director, did an 
interesting job, although the film used (and abused) CGI and special 
effects. The photo is very bright and colorful, sometimes it even looks 
like an animation.

This movie is a good movie to watch with the 
family. The younger ones will probably like it more than the adults, but
 the film has something to give to the grown up too, especially in the 
final half, where the film takes on more dramatic force.",
182,BeneCumb,6,Visually effective shallow story,"Although I recognize that I do not belong to the main target audience, I
 am able to compare several fairy-tale movies with an extensive use of 
digital effects, and, even in this context, I cannot say that Maleficent
 would generally stick out. True, Angelina Jolie as Maleficent is very 
good, but she is the only versatile and solid figure; otherwise good Sam
 Riley and Imelda Staunton had too small and plain characters to play. 
For the child/teen roles, the choice was evidently based on ""cute"" 
appearance, and Sharlto Copley is not versatile enough to be a due 
villain (I had similar feeling in Elysium). 

As for its visual 
effects, yes, they create a fitting atmosphere, but types and movements 
of different creatures have been used in many prior movies, e.g. 
Transformer and Percy Jackson series, so they have lost their novelty 
and marvelousness.

The story itself is uneven, with questionable 
moments and unnecessary scenes, and with too obvious moralizing on 
topics such as good and evil, love and friendship, loyalty and 
betrayal... Even children are able to obtain necessary values via deeds 
and images, it is not required to put them into exact words.

Hence,
 a cartoon-like twisted fairy tale, specially created for good box 
office due to the inclusion of Jolie and fairy-tale environment, but at 
the expense of seamless narration.",
183,estebangonzalez10,6,Jolie is Maleficent/Magnificent,"""Listen well, you all! The princess will indeed grow in grace and 
beauty. But before the sunset on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick 
her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel, and she will fall into a 
sleep like death!""

Maleficent isn't a masterpiece and it actually
 has several flaws, but it was much better than I had anticipated 
considering the latest failed attempts at bringing a beloved classic 
fairytale to the big screen through live action. Snow White, Jack the 
Giant Slayer, Cinderella, Hansel & Gretel, Beauty and the Beast, all
 failed in their adaptations so I didn't have high expectations for 
Maleficent. They all seem to share something in common which is that 
they always incorporate a spin on the classic tale, and Maleficent is no
 exception as there is a big twist to the familiar story. They played it
 safe with the twist in Maleficent, and it was rather cliché, but it 
worked nonetheless. Despite not being a huge fan of this genre I decided
 to give this film a shot because I was looking forward to Angelina 
Jolie's comeback (her previous starring role in a feature film was in 
2010's The Tourist alongside Johnny Depp). Jolie doesn't disappoint and 
she carries the entire film giving a strong performance. Many complained
 that they wished the film would've centered more on her character as a 
villain than a hero, but I actually enjoyed the duality in her 
performance and the struggle she faces while dealing with her betrayal. 
She owns this movie, but it didn't hurt that the she had a strong cast 
to work with; I loved Elle Fanning in her role as Aurora, Sharlto Copley
 as the ambitious King (if there was ever a film in which he could go 
overboard with his character this was it, but strangely he played it 
safe here), and of course I can't leave out Sam Riley who was great as 
Diaval. Perhaps I enjoyed this film more than others because I went into
 it with fairly low expectations, but compared to other recent fairytale
 adaptations this film is superior and one I'm sure the new generation 
will appreciate.

Maleficent is a retelling of Disney's classic 
animated film, Sleeping Beauty, although this time the screenplay 
written by Linda Woolverton centers on the villain. The film begins by 
introducing us to the young fairy named Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy) 
living an ideal and peaceful life in the Moors, which is full of magical
 creatures. On the other side of the Moors lies the human kingdom which 
is ruled by an ambitious King. One day Maleficent is warned by the 
forest guards that they have caught a human trying to steal a jewel from
 the Moors. Maleficent discovers that the thief is actually a boy named 
Stefan (Michael Higgins), who she kindly asks to return the jewel. She 
then escorts him out of the Moors, but when he returns the two bond and 
become good friends. As time passes the two fall in love, but their 
relationship doesn't last long once he becomes ambitious. The film jumps
 forward many years and now we follow the adult Maleficent (Angelina 
Jolie) as she continues to protect the Moors from King Henry (Kenneth 
Cranham) and his army. The adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) happens to be 
serving the King now, and he and his men are ordered to kill Maleficent.
 Whoever does so will become his successor to the throne. Stefan heads 
to the Moors to warn Maleficent of the king's intention, but blinded by 
his ambition to become king he betrays her. This turns Maleficent's once
 pure heart into one full of hate and a desire for revenge. When Stefan 
becomes King, Maleficent curses his newborn infant Aurora and claims she
 will fall into a sleep like death once she turns 16 and only a true 
love's kiss will be able to break the curse.

The best thing 
Maleficent has going for it apart from Angelina Jolie's lead performance
 and the strong ensemble cast, is the fact that it was directed by 
Robert Stromberg who has a strong record as a production designer. 
Despite the fact that this was Stromberg's first feature film he has a 
lot of experience in the art direction department (actually winning two 
Oscars for his work in Acatar and Alice in Wonderland). Maleficent looks
 great and the art direction may be it's best asset. The visual effects 
and the fantastical creatures of the Moors are stunning. The screenplay 
may have its flaws and the story may fall into a predictable and clichéd
 final act, but it always looks great. This may be yet another case of 
style over substance, but the cast elevate the material and make this a 
much better film than it has any right to be. The weakest elements of 
the film for me involve the portrayal of the three fairies who are 
tasked with taking care of Aurora and raising her. Those comedic moments
 felt a bit forced and the characters didn't have much substance to 
them. However, the scenes that Maleficent and Aurora share together are 
solid as Jolie captures the inner struggle she faces when she's 
confronted by Aurora's innocence and beauty. Sam Riley also shares some 
great scenes alongside Jolie and those were the best moments of the film
 for me. The film does suffer from a slow introduction and a weak final 
act, but the middle act was really strong and that is why I actually 
enjoyed Maleficent.",
184,Amyth47,6,Dark Disney is Awesome!,"My Rating : 6/10

Everything reminds me of a Guillermo Del Toro 
film though it's a Disney movie - this is good as the dark setting is 
very suited to this storyline without it being too obnoxious.

'Maleficent' is well-made and worth a watch if in the mood for a fantastical good vs evil CGI feature.

Enjoyed it!",
185,moviexclusive,6,The truth behind Disney's iconic villain turns out to be a visual treat that could have benefited from a tad more evil,"The folks at The House of Mouse have been known to make you feel good – 
even in the lousiest of days. On a good day, you'd be thankful for that 
(Watching Disney productions like Saving Mr Banks and Frozen have had 
extremely positive effect on depressed people), while on bad days, you 
wish things could turn a little wicked (Wasn't the mermaid in The Little
 Mermaid supposed to turn into a bubble and burst? Surely Quasimodo from
 The Hunchback of Notre Dame could be more hideous?)

When we 
heard that Disney is going to produce a live action movie based on 
Maleficent, we were thrilled. We're talking about one of the evilest 
villains from the 1959 classic Sleeping Beauty. That sharply angled 
face, that irritating crow and need we mention those horns. The Mistress
 of All Evil, as we know her, wasn't too pleased when she found out that
 she wasn't invited to the royal christening of the kingdom's infant 
princess. Cue a terrible curse that would cause the princess to prick 
her finger and sleep forever, magic potions that look too venomous for 
comfort and lots of evil crackly laughter.

Now, Disney wants to 
tell you the truth – one that will have you understanding why 
Maleficent's pure heart was turned to stone, a betrayal that involves a 
royal kingdom and a dastardly forest and of course, a beautiful princess
 that may be the key to peace in the land.

Or so says the marketing copy.

When
 the publicity trailers were first released online, we were impressed by
 leading lady Angelina Jolie's uncanny resemblance to the animated 
Maleficent. That cold glare, that menacing stare and that depraved 
cackle: Jolie has effortlessly managed to send quivers down our spine. 
Then came Lana Del Ray's cover of ""Once Upon A Dream"", the single that 
will serve as the title song for the movie. The American singer 
songwriter's haunting vocals was a perfect match for what seemed to be a
 sinister ride down our memory lane of this beloved fairy tale. 

While
 the 97 minute movie is a feast for the eyes (cinematography by Dean 
Semler boasts numerous fantastical scenes filled with fairies and forest
 creatures), and the action scenes are excitingly choreographed (the 
battle between man and nature, and the finale showdown between soldiers 
and a ferocious dragon are easily impressible pieces), you can't run 
away from the fact that this is a Disney production.

Jolie is 
aptly dark and menacing in her outfits designed by Anna B Sheppard, and 
the Academy Award winning actress snarls and growls like a true villain,
 but as the story progresses, you get a nudging feeling that everything 
will turn out fine in the end. Without giving away too much, yes, it is a
 happy ending that is so family friendly, you'll wonder where that 
cynical realism was chucked after leaving the theatre.

First time
 feature director Robert Stromberg (known for his visual effects work on
 movies like Life of Pi and The Hunger Games) is clearly a visually 
driven filmmaker. The movie is a joy to look at, and competent 
performances by a supporting cast of Sharlto Copley as King Stefan, Sam 
Riley as a raven shapeshifter and Imelda Staunton, JunoTempleand Lesley 
Manville as the pixie fairies don't hurt the movie either. Bonus points 
also come in the form of the likable Elle Fanning who takes on the role 
of Princess Aurora.

We just wished that this potentially sinister tale could have been peppered with more ominous cynicism and menace.",
186,adamscastlevania2,6,Too little girl focused,"(55%) Without doubt a mixed bag. The opening 10 or so minutes are far 
too sweet and kid friendly for my taste, but the real fly in the soup is
 the fact that Maleficent herself is at no point actually evil in the 
slightest. She is for the most part slightly bitter, much more so than 
out-and-out evil, or even bad, and as there's no real arc to her 
character the movie feels a little hollow and somewhat lacking. Jolie 
though is pretty fantastic and the movie splutters whenever she's off 
screen, but the 3 annoying fairy characters are given far too much 
attention that they really don't warrant in the slightest deducting from
 some good, exciting scenes. Overall If it had more bite, and the script
 was polished to a higher degree then this could have been a classic in 
waiting, but sadly not.",
187,estreet-eva,6,Jumping on the rethinking-the-villain trend Disney-style,"Since ""Wicked"" opened up the concept of an original work that draws 
heavily from a famous work by rethinking the villain of the original and
 finding some sympathy, it was only a matter of time before we got to 
""Sleeping Beauty"". And a visually arresting rethink it is. The 
transformation of crow to man, the battle of Angelina Jolie (who seems a
 generally frightening person with or without ludicrously oversized 
horns) versus the army of the human world and numerous other CGI-heavily
 special effects all delight. The story does not quite live up to the 
telling with Angelina's baddie-turned-goodie seemingly spending some 16 
years hiding in the bushes and secretly protecting the original damsel 
in distress Sleeping Beauty from harm. The running gag of the three 
fairies losing focus on Baby Beauty and her wandering into mortal danger
 before Jolie saves her gets a little disconcerting after a while - did 
the Moors have no Child Protective Services? Anyway, the acting is 
respectable, the script passable and the entertainment value for the 
younger set reasonable. In short, worth renting on family movie night if
 something better isn't on offer.",
188,fciocca,6,"A live action movie with stunning visual effects, but not my cup of tea","Maleficent is one of those movies that I would never watch, but my 
girlfriend love this genre, so I watched it, by having real low 
expectations. Because of this, I was very surprised, and I actually 
enjoyed it quite a lot.

Technically speaking, I found it 
stunning, CGI sequences are so amazing and realistic, the Maleficent 
world is well conceived and people who worked on it put a lot of effort 
in details: monsters, landscapes and locations are breathtaking. For a 
while I did not see something so amazing.

To complete this live 
action, you need to have a good cast. Angelina Jolie plays Maleficent, 
and she is surprisingly good, even in a complete different role that she
 is used to. She is bad, but at the same time caring and she takes care 
of Aurora for 16 years, by becoming her Fairy Stepmother, but she can 
also be bad with people that deserve. An interesting character with a 
good development. Elle Fanning in this movie does not have the time to 
express herself, writers did not gave to the Aurora character a lot of 
space. I love Elle's work as an actress, but this time she was decent, 
but I know that she can do better, she has demonstrated this in ""Neon 
Demon"", but not in this movie. Maybe this character had too many 
limitations, so she couldn't perform as well as she previously did.

Maleficent was not was I expecting and the trailer does not give the right idea to the movie. There is a perfect balance.",
189,kermitkid,6,"""Wicked"" ripoff","Disney really needs some new ideas. Making a prequel to a movie that's

clichè and Angelina Jolie's acting was too over-the-top. I didn't like 
that.the premise was ""the villian isn't evil, just misunderstood."" Like I

190,nicolechan916,6,A little disappointing,"To be honest, I was expecting more from this film. It was kind of a let 
down. The story itself was all right, but more suited for children. I 
know it's a Disney movie, but Disney has always been able to make movies
 that adults could enjoy too. Their most recent hit; Frozen, was 
enjoyable to pretty much the whole world. And now that I think about it,
 there was surprisingly no singing in this film. I've just read how this
 adaptation is different from the Sleeping Beauty film, and I feel that 
the original story was better.

The acting was good, and we did 
get a sense of the characters and where they came from, but it just felt
 shallow to me. Angelina Jolie makes a pretty good Maleficent and the 
three fairies are somewhat like the three stooges; they added a comical 
element which was a good addition to the film. Also, I give a thumbs up 
to the chemistry between Maleficent and Diaval.

The animation was
 pretty good as well. The landscapes and scenery had a very fantastical 
and mystical feel, while the visual effects I feel, could have been 
better. The actionwas kind of average. Just your normal everyday 
Hollywood fight that starts with no apparent reason whatsoever.

191,ghost_dog86,6,Trust No Man,"I can't be the only one who didn't realize Maleficent was a fairy and 
not a witch, right?! Now that I got that out of the way, on to my 
review: While more tolerable than 2012's ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" 
or ""Mirror Mirror"", ""Maleficent"", a retelling of ""Sleeping Beauty"", 
starring Elle Fanning and Angelina Jolie (in what may be one of her 
final on-screen performances) will not help the case for live action 
remakes of classic animated fairy tales.

Synopsis: A retelling of
 ""Sleeping Beauty"", told from Maleficent's point of view; Maleficent 
played by Jolie, Aurora played by Fanning.

The script and creative plot reconstruction from writer Linda Woolverton, is the best aspect of ""Maleficent"".

Side
 Note: I understand that the story of Sleeping Beauty predates Disney. 
But since ""Maleficent"" is basically Disney remaking Disney, I will be 
addressing 1959's ""Sleeping Beauty"" as the source material. So, deal 
with it.

The back-story element (how Maleficent came to be seen 
as a villain) while a bore to sit through, actually injects a refreshing
 motive, as this film enters its 2nd Act. Even the ending, which 
randomly sees Angelina Jolie in leather pants, and also holds the most 
significant plot deviation, works. All of this workson paper. Seeing it
 all play out in live action is quite a different story. Most of the CGI
 is simply awful. And in a movie which is composed of 80% CGI, including
 odd looking CGI creatures, CGI battle sequences and CGI floating 
people, ""Maleficent"" had me wondering if animation is necessary if only 
to make stories regarding fantasy more palatable. That said, this is not
 the biggest directorial flaw in this film. The countless extreme 
close-ups throughout come off as devastatingly amateurish, giving an 
unintentional campiness to moments that were meant to be taken 
seriously.

But is visual effects artist/director Robert Stromberg
 to blame for all of this film's shortcomings? Well, mostly, but the 
horrendous supporting cast (Fanning not included) doesn't help.

As
 for Mrs. Brad Pitt's performance, I have no complaints. And once this 
movie gets going (it is an absolute snoozer for the first 30 minutes) 
and she gets a chance to literally and metaphorically spread her wings 
and camp it up, Jolie becomes one of the only things keeping the 
entertainment levels elevated.

Final Thought: Anyone who comes 
out of ""Maleficent"" dismissing it on the basis of story alterations or 
their personal hatred of Angelina Jolie, should really just get over it.
 If anything, dismiss this film on its shockingly off-putting visuals. 
On the plus side, and maybe most importantly, if you're looking for a 97
 minute babysitter, ""Maleficent"" is a movie which will keep the 
attention of most children and/or childlike fans of the outdated 
""Sleeping Beauty"". Take that for what it's worth.",
192,MJB784,6,A split decision,"I found it very frustratingly uneven. Visually the location and 
production design was fascinating, but the special effects were mostly 
fake and didn't blend to the performances which were mostly just 
standing by with nothing the do and the flying scenes with the fairies 
looked too fake like an old video game sequence. Angelina wasn't that 
menacing in Maleficent. She played it very hammy where she was over 
emphasizing the lines and didn't seem that mean. The story is just as 
uneven since it wants to be both a retelling of Sleeping Beauty and a 
brand new story about Maleficent so the main character is both 
Maleficent and Princess Aurora. They also changed some of the story and 
it made me not sure if certain parts were supposed to be funny or 
serious and Maleficent as a character was just as unfocused emotionally.
 Why couldn't they just retell Sleeping Beauty or tell a prequel of 
Maleficent instead of combining the two? My mind was feeling like I was 
watching two movies fused together!",

Actors: 6/10

Plot/script: 5/10

Photography/visual style: 5/10

Music/score: 6/10

Overall: 6/10

The
 problem with Maleficent is that it can't decide what kind of story it 
wants to be. It draws from three distinct narrative traditions that are 
at odds with each other, and never truly resolves the conflicts that 
result.

Officially, it is based on Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty', 
but it takes the opportunity to re-assess the story and twist it by 
turning the villain Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) into a misunderstood 
heroine. I support this idea: the existing story wouldn't really work 
for a modern audience. However, in doing so, it draws on the folk tales 
which inspired the 1959 film, as well as taking it forward with a 
post-modern style of re-analysis, and the fact is that the folk tale, 
Disney adventure and post-modern story are simply too contradictory to 
sit well alongside each other.

Admittedly, they cast the lead 
role perfectly. One suspects from her executive producer credit that 
Angelina has been on board since the early stages: she has exactly the 
kind of star power required to get a project like this off the ground. 
She lights up the screen with the kind of accustomed charisma earned 
from being at the very top of the game for 15 years, as well as being 
one of the acknowledged most beautiful women in the world. Indeed, if 
anything, she is too radiant, eclipsing even Aurora (Elle Fanning), who 
is supposed to have magically enhanced beauty.

Given that the 
director Robert Stromberg is a first-timer more experienced in the 
realms of special effects and art direction, it is no surprise that the 
look of the film is stunning. The environments constructed are 
sumptuous, jammed with detail, and invested with all the brightness and 
energy the latest computer technology can bring to bear.

As long 
as you are willing to live with the thematic drive being all over the 
place, there are two great reasons to watch this film: Angelina Jolie 
and the cracking special effects. For me, it came away a bit tarnished, 
but ultimately positive, on balanced.",

197,Alise_shenle,6,Better Than Expected,"I watched this movie twice, and I think it is still pretty entertaining 
the second time round, so this shows that it is a good movie. We can't 
blame the plot for its ""loopholes"" or things that don't make sense, 
because it is based on the stupid fairytale, after all. So Maleficent 
already tried to build a story based on the really simple original. 
Firstly, I really like all the actors. Despite Elle Fanning's not really
 being a stunning beauty (perhaps she has not grown up enough yet), she 
has this smile that shows she's naive and innocent. Brendon Thwaites (I 
just saw him in Oculus) was really just acting like a lovestruck boy so 
he doesn't do much. Diaval was cute, and Angelina Jolie acted really 
well, both as the innocent fairy, evil witch and loving mother. It was 
also really satisfying seeing Dolores Umbridge being the old fairy who 
was bullied by the two younger ones. However, some things are 
problematic. The ending was also not a plagiarism of Frozen, because 
Anna and Elsa are sisters so of course they truly love each other, but 
you don't have to love your enemy's child. 1. Why on earth are the 3 
fairies traitors? They suddenly decided to help the King, despite 
knowing that the King did wrong first, and somemore they still obey his 
every move and are scared of him? Where are their loyalties? 2. The 
tyrant King Stefan. Since he is of lowly birth and not even a good King,
 why doesn't anyone rebel? Hell, even mediocre Kings got overthrown, 
just look at China's emperors who were birthed by concubines and not the
 Queen, they had to listen to the ministers. He didn't even love his 
wife, so why didn't she rebel? 3. The iron part was not really utilised.
 Why doesn't Maleficent become more wary since she knew Stefan knew iron
 hurts her? Why didn't Stefan told the old King? 4. Why did the soldiers
 catapult fire into the trees all at once? A better way would be to 
experiment using just one. The humans appear to be stupid, they have no 
advanced weaponry yet still dare to fight against FAIRIES! 5. Why did 
Stefan become obsessed with killing Malefcent? He didn't even like his 
own daughter that much, or his wife. So he shouldn't care about his 
daughter's survival. I think Stefan had a low self-esteem, he is 
secretly jealous of Maleficent's power. He is also ambitious. However, 
he should be smarter than that, like remain on Maleficent's good side to
 ask her to use her magic to help him get the throne or something. Not 
fight against her, because she will lose. Overall, just watch for 
Angelina Jolie. She is a good actor and not to mention good-looking.

198,FallsDownz,6,Well Well.... best line ever from Angelina Jolie,"Maleficent is a new Sleeping Beauty movie from Disney which instead the 
main characters is Maleficent , and it's promise to be something new to 
be something you never heard before, unfortunately it's true form are 
nowhere near it's promises .

The movie has a lots of problem like
 the script which is really dull contain with dull one-dimension 
characters (except Maleficent herself) and the new storyline they 
promise is nothing new or something that will surprise you at all , in 
fact they didn't changed much at all from the original sleeping beauty 
animation .

The Director Robert Stromberg are pretty good on 
visual effects the CG is really cool and beautiful to look at but his 
directing skills is nowhere near the same level as his visual skills , 
his directing is pretty dull with no experience and how to telling the 
story what so ever makes a lot of times in the movie feels boring.

but
 there's a brightside in this movie too and that is Angelina Jolie 
herself she's perfect in this movie as Malificent her performance is 
really amazing and i cannot think who better to play as Malificent than 
her.

But that's not enough though with only Jolie and Visual 
Effects against the boring script , dull characters and dull directing ,
 Maleficent in the end is a movie that has a strong promises but cannot 
deliver.",
199,jctundis,6,"Jolie is masterful, but the character of Maleficent is ruined.","The Maleficent movie. You know, it wasn't that bad. From a visual 
standpoint, it was really cool. I liked the play of dark and light. 
There were ominous scenes interspersed with colorful, playful ones - a 
metaphor for Maleficent's dual personality perhaps.

The biggest 
drawback? The story. My biggest ""fear"" going in was the obvious fact 
(judging from the trailers) that the film makers were going to turn 
Maleficent into a sympathetic character. They did that in spades, to an 
almost nightmarish neo-feminist ret-con level by rendering Maleficent 
into not just a sympathetic character, but a jilted lover, victim and 
full on hero of the Sleeping Beauty saga. Every male character was 
rendered callow or completely neutered. Maleficent, perhaps the greatest
 full-on villain in the Disney oeuvre, absolutely relishing in her 
wickedness, was forever altered into just another boring ""warrior 
queen."" We no longer have a personae we ""love to hate"" - we have a 
misunderstood soul we ""feel bad for."" But she does get a happy ending...

Anyway,
 the absolute best reason to see this movie is Angelina Jolie. I've been
 a fan for ages, and this once again illustrates why. Not only is she 
absolutely beautiful, but she is also both magnificent and malevolent in
 certain scenes that are magical.",
200,Imaculata,6,"Not as good as I hoped, better than people say","I have very mixed feelings about this movie. It has gorgeous visuals and
 an amazing performance by Angelina Jolie, yet all the other actors pale
 in comparison, and are miscast. Plus the effects dominate the film too 
much. But worst of all, is that the story is a mess, it breaks 
completely with the original tale of Sleeping Beauty near the end. Oh, 
and it rips off the ending to Snow White and the Huntsman. Having a 
twist near the end is nice, but we have seen this exact same twist 
several times now in better movies. And it's painfully obvious that 
they've borrowed heavily from Snow White and the Huntsman, but to also 
steal the twist ending? On the other hand, the 3D works great. But I 
can't help but feel this movie would have benefited from more real sets 
and costumes, rather than having so many CGI backdrops and creatures. 
It's overkill, and it takes you out of the story. It also feels like 
they've rewritten the ending at the last moment. There are several plot 
points from the original fairy tale that are set up, and left completely
 unresolved. For example, the entire kingdom falling into a deep slumber
 is a pretty important plot point to just leave out completely. It's 
basically one of the most well known parts of the fairy tale, and they 
even set it up, and then leave it out. Why? What happened when they 
wrote this? It's such a shame, because when Angelina does play evil, 
she's epic. What a waste.

Every other character besides 
Maleficent is completely flat. It's really easy to make Maleficent seem 
like the hero, when everyone else is a cardboard cut out, and acts like 
either a fool or a jerk. They really did not spend any time fleshing out
 any of the other characters.

This is not a movie you need to see
 in the theater. It won't ruin your evening either, but it had the 
potential to be so much more.",
