1,jgaaar,"As little as I felt I delved into the personalities of the characters, I did enjoy the film a lot. Shinkai's metaphorical use of trains just continuing to go along their routes that diverge in several ways really applies in this film, as much as it did in 5 Centimeters per Second. Everyone's lives diverge in different ways, things happen in dreams and are forgotten the next day, things happen in reality and are forgotten over a lifetime. I enjoyed Taki's and Mitsuha's struggles throughout the film to help each other, and as much as it made me well up tears in my eyes, I enjoyed his questioning of how much our memories make up who we are.",9
2,Builder_K,"Spectacular animation. There is one particular scene near the beginning which has a sort of ""3D camera rotation"" that looks so real that I thought it was rendered; but at the last second, the character turned their head, and I was able to tell that it had been read more",10
3,Zephariel,"Overall I'm not saying this movie is utter rubbish, but its definitely not a masterpiece either and it's definitely not a movie which deserves to be on the top spot especially with the lack of originality of the story. What surprises me the most is that some people realized this and still giving it a 10/10. I definitely won't recommend this to anyone unless you want an anime similar to The Lake House, well here you go!",5
4,Satire,"Overall, Kimi no Na wa was a very good film, though not nearly as perfect as many people, who have also seen the premiere, are claiming it to be. There are a few issues that hold the film back, but it is easily still worth two hours of anyone's time. With Makoto Shinkai creating quality works such as Your Name, it has, and will, become increasingly difficult to forget his.",8

Given that Shinkai is a master, anything he makes is obviously going to be a ""masterpiece,"" but among silt there is gold, and among gold there may be diamonds.

7,TheKillerAngel,"“Kimi no Na wa.” (Your Name) opens with a radiant comet traversing over the night sky, splitting apart into various meteors that illuminate and streak the heavens. Stars and celestial imagery often feature in Makoto Shinkai’s films, and the brilliance of the opening set piece could be dismissed as eye-candy. However, its significance is not fully understood until much later. To speak of names, one does not invoke Makoto Shinkai in conjunction with the phrase “happy ending.” To say that he has made his fame off producing romance anime is only half the story, as his work’s exploration of themes such as distance and unrequited love read more",10

His majority of works relies mainly on the visual effect where each frame speak a word for itself,the tension he creates between the characters,the emotion he depicts with that and overall execution which even makes a simplest of the story somewhat extraordinary to watch.

9,mramirez96,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS

Oh, look at this, another anime that is highly overrated because it's pretty colours. Let's see together what is supposed to make this movie special, popular and loved:

1. Beginning: The movie already started with a plot convenience with the body swap. It was never explained how it works, what are the possible consequences and how can be reversed. Also, this premise is used for a comic purpose instead of trying to explore how this affects the protagonists psychologically and, through this premise, they could even have increased their empathy thanks to the experience of the exchange of bodies. There were more interesting ideas that could have been executed with this premise, although in the end they used it as a joke.

2. Characters: The protagonists are, basically, a comic relief during the first half. We know little to nothing about them beyond all the comedy they performed with them. In the second half, they were a failed attempt of time traveling superheroes. I'm not lying when I say that the characterization and/or backstory is nearly inexistent.

3. Time Traveling: This trope was used in the most retarded and convenient way possible. It is introduced because yes, it is never explained how it works, during the time traveling they always ended meeting each other, which is quite convenient. Why don't they end up on different timelines? How many days in time did they go back? Because they never said it during the movie, on any of the occasions. Also, the amnesia for time traveling appears when it suits the script best. Even they met in spiritual form, wtf? That's how retarded this movie is. And what the protagonists did after they met during time travelings? Nothing that contributes to the plot, story or character development.

4. The second half: After the introduction of time traveling, our protagonists try to change a past event that could have killed thousands of people. And why did they do that? They never knew about this case in first place. And how did they planned to do it? This part happened behind the scenes, for real? The writers were lazy even for their biggest plot twist. At the end, the case was solved without any time paradox, even if this doesn't make sense. Talking to the last sentence, of in the original time line, the deaths never happened, so all this plot twist was a total nonsense.

5. Ending: After the solving of the case, later, they met each other and magically remembered everything that happened. What a great way to end this movie.

Conclusion: It was terrible in many levels, if I didn't rated lower was because the animation and production values. ",3
10,dbdasm,"While the movie wasn't terrible, I was disappointed because I had high expectations for it. Most of the reviews seem to be overwhelming positive and it is ranked first so I guess most people enjoyed it. However for me, the story lacked alot while the art was outstanding (which is my opinion on most Makoto Shinkai's works).

STORY
I found the first half of the movie to be enjoyable and after the plot-twist, it kind of went downhill. The sci-fi element wasn't executed very well, alot of the times it felt as if happened all for plot convenience. The time travel and constant body-switching felt too much to me. I admit I was bored in the second half (which was pretty predictable). Also there is alot of inconsistencies which led to confusion.

ART AND SOUND
Art was amazing and sound was average (left no impression).

CHARACTERS
The two main characters aren't anything special. They are just your typical female and male lead who want to save everybody. There isn't too much to comment on them because there is nothing beyond them to analyse than what the show directly shows to you.

The female lead does get a little character development when she becomes more assertive to her father towards the end but honestly that's almost nothing. The minor characters were entertaining but also nothing special.

OVERALL
I think this movie is overrated. Yes, the art is amazing but in terms of plot is is average. For me, it left no impact or anything to think about or feel.

11,cairobaby,"I got to say, I generally don't rate visually stunning anime anywhere 
lower than 5. So this is basically me saying - I was disappointed but 
not because of the art, the art was amazing!



I think the amount of hype that this anime received was astronomically 
high. Which really might have made me felt very much confused by my 
feelings when I was watching the movie. 



I tried my hardest to love the anime. But I really couldn't. 



The thing that I didn't like about this anime the most is the 
inconsistency in the flow of the movie. The abruptness that left me 
feeling unsatisfied

          
        and could not fully invest into the characters' struggles. 



I WISH I loved it as it's one of my hobbies to watch an anime and feel 
fully invested into the story while making a connection to my feelings. 
But I didn't.



I would recommend anyone to watch it and see for yourself though, it's 
an interesting phenomenon that this movie received such high praises. 
See for yourself and judge it yourself :)",2
12,Bluekite,"Now why the score of 8 out of 10 when I've been addressing quite the heavy complaint? While the second half starts to crumble the strong start the movie has, I still enjoy and love the movie overall. The ending is satisfactory that, despite having traces of forcefulness to it, is a good change of storytelling in comparison to his previous works such as 5 Centimeters Per Second where there is no definite resolution like a happy ending. I do think that the movie deserves credit for trying to do more with its story despite being partly a failure and a success. Unlike Shinkai's previous films that tend to be overwhelmingly melancholic and distant, Kimi no Na wa assimilates the feeling of a passionate youth which I really like and find beautiful. I like the contrast of the two settings albeit I hoped for a better world-building. I kind of blame myself for having a soft spot for these kinds of coming-of-age stories. The production is great from the gorgeous visuals to the heartwarming soundtrack. I believe that Shinkai can still put out better projects given that his story writing ability has more consistency and substance to it. Whatever the consensus is, this movie will definitely leave an impact to the curious viewer.",8

Middle: I can’t stay with you forever.
End: I hope we see each other again.

You may be asking: With such a basic structure, how can any of his films be so successful? It’s all about the flesh. read more",7
16,xthorgoldx,"Makoto Shinkai is a name that, to many, equates with “feels.” Whether it’s Voices from a Distant Star, the Children Who Chase Lost Voices, or the classic 5 Centimeters per Second, Shinkai’s films carry the guarantee of beautiful animation and emotional depth rarely seen in anime. Kimi no Na Wa, “Your Name,” is no exception to the trend. If anything, Your Name is the end product of years of experimentation with storytelling and filmmaking – the story that Shinkai has always wanted, and tried, to tell, finally made real, and done so in a satisfying, entertaining, and heart-wrenching way.

Your Name is the story of two people: Mitsuha Miyamizu, a shrine maiden in the rural Japanese countryside, and Taki Tachibana, a stock standard highschool student in Tokyo. Their irregular body-swapping isn’t the sort that leaves much of a solid mark – their memories of swaps are hazy, and they can’t exactly take notes with them, and more importantly they’ve never even met. Yet here, one of the first themes Shinkai communicates comes forward – the echoes left by a person’s life, by their actions and in the people around them, is just as good as meeting the person themselves. Mitsuha and Taki both get to learn about each other not only during their body swaps, but in seeing the aftereffects of each others’ antics while swapped, be it Taki’s boldness in her body or Mitsuha’s setting up Taki’s love life in his. Love, as told by Shinkai, is more than just affection for a person – it’s in the things we do for others and what they do for us.

The core theme of Your Name is “musubi” – a word that describes coming together and growing apart, starting a journey and reaching its conclusion, and the ebb and flow of time and fate. It is a word that, perhaps, summarizes the whole of Makoto Shinkai’s stories on the topic of love and fate – it describes the insatiable urge to find the one you’re destined to be with, as explored in Voices from a Distant Star, and likewise the unavoidable flow of time that pulls people apart and leads to new beginnings, as in 5 Centimeters per Second. The topic of musubi dominates the story of Your Name, in a manner that makes the movie both coherent in its own plot and insightful in its approach to the standard “red string of fate” story.

It is difficult to put into words exactly why Your Name resonates on the threads it does (pun intended), but it has to do with the raw elegance with which the theme of musubi is presented. It encompasses both the sappy and giddy optimism of true love winning out, and the melancholy acceptance of time moving on. It perfectly describes the “why” to the red string of fate, and why that symbol holds so much power in the mind.

Of course, it goes without saying that the fundamentals of Your Name – the animation, the voice acting, and the like – are of the top quality. The name that Shinkai has made for himself and his works in regards to raw quality is strong for a reason – Your Name does not disappoint visually, or audibly. Of particular note is the ear-orgasming soundtrack, provided by RADWIMPS, who provided both the trailer music as well as several in-film songs. Rather than simply searching for music that matched his artistic vision retroactively, Makoto Shinkai sought out RADWIMPS’ inclusion in the film from the get-go, and the result of integrating them so early into the creative process is evident every time the film’s soundtrack gets going. If nothing else, Your Name is a movie that can be watched for the music.

Your Name is, if anything, a classic Makoto Shinkai work. It is beautiful, both in visuals and in story. It tugs at the heartstrings, appealing to things that every viewer can identify with, either out of personal experience or out of desire to experience. But more than anything else, it leaves the audience satisfied, throughout its runtime and in its conclusion, with a story well told. Your Name handily takes its place as not just my favorite Shinkai film, but my favorite film entirely",10
17,Dar-Krusos,"By no means is this a bad anime, however it is far from worthy of the number one spot on MAL. The story is well-written and one of the most well-structured anime I have seen in a while, however the story itself is quite lacking in that it doesn't show enough character development. The concepts that the director have instilled in the characters are very pronounced and admirable, however it is belief that others see this as true character development. Even at the end of this show, it felt that the characters themselves were rushed and were easily predictable, making them quite cheesy (though that seems to not be something the director focused on). All in all, it IS a movie; this does not, however, mean that it is better than anime series just because it can compact many ideas.
Although the main concept of alternating lives is an intriguing one I haven't come across before, it does not make up for the rest of the story, which lacks in depth. It is good to watch as a simple, well-constructed movie, but it does not have all the characteristics required for the most astonishing and creative anime.
Verdict sentence: Over-hype.",8
18,M1KAGA,"Quite simply and with approval, I do not advise you to watch this movie unless you are crazy or a lover of Sakuga.

Drawing, animation, production and animation are more than sophisticated, making you amazed.

Change this story in the rock bottom always, a cliched scenario with a 
plot and no worse with a very horrific random application, the design of
 the characters is good but the characters are bad, one-dimensional and 
their behavior is mindless.

The romance in this movie is dirty and illogical

Without spoiling the movie entirely, the film takes a huge turn somewhere around the middle where it becomes more than just an animated Freaky Friday.

20,Selth333,"Shinkai's 2016 film Your Name stands to many as his magnum opus, but in 
2021 does it hold up? Well i'd argue it was never a good movie story 
wise. Aside from the breathtaking visuals this film lacks the characters
 and execution to make a good romance film. This film starts off poorly 
as it takes a while to even get into the main course. The first 30 
minutes seemingly feel dragged on and boring. Furthermore, the 
characters also hardly have any distinct personality or good traits... 
especially Taki.... He is primarily just a cardboard cutout meant for 
you to self insert and its gross.

          
        Mitsuha is less dull as she has a little more character 
throughout the film but it doesn't really matter because the backstory 
and character seems to amount to nothing. This films gimmick also 
doesn't seem to work due to the fact that the characters don't interact 
and are merely attracted to each other based on their lifestyle. This 
also makes for very dull and uninteresting sequences throughout the film
 as they seemingly carry no weight and merely drag on and drag. This 
film also feels rushed in some places and it's hard to tell what's going
 on sometimes. All through those negatives though there are some good 
things. For example. The great animation. That's kind of it.



Now the ending of this seems kinda.... why? I don't see what pulled at 
everyone's heartstrings... It's left open and feels unrewarding 
especially for the bad characters and drag of a story it was. At least 
give us a clear ending that doesn't leave fans and many others guessing.",3

There's nothing worse to me than a super dramatic story where I don't connect with the characters and don't feel the emotions they're trying to throw at me. I'm glad other people are enjoying it, but it is very flawed in many areas.",6

With characters as flat as cardboard and a story that could have been mastered by a five year old, Your name has positive ratings and that fact has baffled me to no end.

His new movie tells a story about a high school student Taki and a high school student Mitsuha suddenly swapping bodies but forgetting what they did during their swap after it ends, so they begin to communicate via diaries and messages left behind by the other person.

24,WasdGarbonzo,"(UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT!!!) 

I do not think this anime is the best thing ever, in fact i think its 
honestly very mediocre and underwhelming. About halfway through i 
accidentally fell asleep for about 15 minutes and missed some stuff, i 
didn't rewatch what i missed and still understood the plot (I think). 
But when i woke up there was like fireworks or something. So i was 
pretty invested because fireworks are cool, but then they all just 
fucking died???? (i think that happened, or maybe i dreamt it when i 
fell asleep) idk it was pretty boring tho. The animation was good i 
guess but

          
        i don't really care about animation. Uhhhhh... The character 
designs are pretty weird (i think the guy had a fat friend, and i like 
that because i'm kinda fat too). The voice acting was okay too. (they 
yell a lot) I like how they have a meteor because it reminds me of 
fortnite season 3 and that's cool. I also like how the main characters 
name is Taki because it reminds me of the chip Takis. (I don't like 
Takis but my friend does so thats cool.) Anyway that's my review for 
your name. Thank you for reading.

25,alexonxanax,"When I saw the reviews and the rating that this anime has got, I was so intrigued. It's been rated much better than FMA:B or Gintama or HxH. Well, I was obviously hyped and unfortunately, this movie did NOT live up to its expectations.

Read on, but mild SPOILERS ahead:

---start of spoilers---
what irked me the most were the obvious GLARING mistakes in the plot. Both these kids exchange each others bodies and live as each other and go to each others school. Now, I dunno about you, but I remember writing dates in my notes EVERYDAY, along with the YEAR. I also always notice the year in my phone, not just the time and date of the month.
Besides, a friggin' meteor falling on a town and killing hundreds is NEWS that's gonna last friggin months along with the devastating video/photos, which is what happens after every calamity. It's ridiculous that none of the people recognised the damn scenery when that town should've been friggin' famous.
Pop culture, politicians, international events are just some of the things that change rapidly over 3, besides the softwares of your phone. Sigh.
---end of spoilers---

So in a nutshell, if you ignore the glaring inconsistencies and plot holes that really make this anime not for those who like a robust story, what you're left with is a cutesy romance story that has a mix of supernatural in it. Yea, doesn't sound spectacular now does it? I definitely wouldn't watch it a second time. The art and sound make the animation pretty good. But the story itself really fails to impress imho. The characters are also nothing special. There isn't much development of either of the two. I suppose it's silly to expect that from a two hour movie in the first place. I don't like stories that put a bit too much drama in it, and well, this one did overdo it a bit with the constant loss of memory for no reason (there was no reason why the guy had to lose memories of a meteor crash, cause it was independent of the girl anyway)
I really don't understand why this has been rated so highly. I guess the ratings will go down eventually.

26,Sakkeru,"If you are well-acquainted with anime history, film, television, art, or any sort of creative thought, then I would advise you not watch this movie. At the most, I only recommend watching this after watching Ghost in The Shell, Redline, or any Miyazaki movie just so you can realize that this movie is a plague to the anime community.

The best thing that can be said about Kimi no Na wa (which if you don't immediately already think is a stupid name, I promise you will by the end of this movie) is that the animation is obviously very good. I don't think that's a great reason to watch an anime, or else we would actually just watch Pacific Rim and Transformers instead of Neon Genesis Evangelion.

The story is fine, essentially a mixture of Freaky Friday and the Notebook. I think the anime community should pay more attention to things outside of anime, and maybe movies like this wouldn't be so successful. But truthfully the story is occasionally touching and interesting. The characters are likeable, but by no means are they interesting.

The TRUE TRAGEDY of this movie is that it epitomizes what the masses criticize about anime: it's a bunch of cutesy fantastical romance to attract 13 year old girls, and if you don't wanna watch some starry-eyed J-pop montage then anime isn't for you. NO!!! If you are reading this I pray that you are here for reasons other than having your first period, and you see something special in anime that can't be found elsewhere. I don't want anime-haters (i.e. most of the entire world) to think THIS is what anime is. Yet here we are, allowing this movie to outrank 30+ years worth of incredible cinema. C'mon guys. This movie's ranking is outright disrespectful.

What Kimi no Na wa presents to the audience is the maturation of director Makoto Shinkai's work. Those familiar with Shinkai's previous works (for example Byousoku 5 Centimeter and Kotonoha no Niwa) should be accustomed to his tendencies of creating bittersweet and unresolved endings; love him or loathe him, Shinkai's latest work demonstrates a slight deviation from this usual style. While the finale of the film remains relatively open-ended, there are many more reasons to be optimistic for what comes after than compared to his previous works.",10
29,pickyviewer,"This movie was disappointing for me. I enjoyed the first third of it, 
and then it steadily went downhill after a specific point. I watched it 
two times, several years apart, and my opinion remains mostly unchanged.
 The movie has pretty art and colors, but the writing and characters 
fall flat. I would not watch this movie on my own accord; I had only 
rewatched it as a means to spend time with a friend who I haven’t spoken
 to in a long time.



- Story. The story has some magical/supernatural elements and time 
skipping, but it’s not difficult to follow. I think there was a

          
        missed opportunity for the movie to become a thriller, due to 
the incremental revelations of the time skipping phenomenon and the 
tragedy that the two main characters try to prevent. Furthermore, there 
needed to be clearer development of two critical aspects for the plot: 
the romantic relationship between the two main characters and buy-in of 
several characters to engage in what is essentially domestic terrorism.



- Characters. The main characters are kind of bland. I think the supporting cast are a little more interesting. 



I don’t have an issue with Mitsuha’s more muted or serious personality, 
but she doesn’t really have more dimension when she is interacting with 
her friends. She is somewhat mischievous when interacting with Taki. 



With Taki, he also acts more serious but the audience is again told by 
another character, not shown, that he is supposedly hot headed. I can 
recall only one scene that actually depicted that part of this 
personality. Another character later tells us that Taki has changed, but
 I don’t see the point in making this statement if there was not a clear
 standard to compare his personality to in the first place.



- Art. Pretty lineart, gorgeous colors, great art and style direction. 



- Animation. Beautiful.



- Music. The actual background music was unmemorable, but the songs with
 lyrics used at several points were really nice. However, I do not have 
an emotional connection to the songs - so they are simply pretty to me. 



- Sound design. Also largely unmemorable, if not for a few well timed suzu bell chimes. 



- Writing. 



To elaborate on what I mentioned in the Story section, the romance was 
really out of place to me. In fact, I think the director was aware of 
this which is why supporting characters had to TELL us that the one of 
the main characters is in love with someone else leading up to the 
confession. There was definitely an entire montage showing the 
development of a close platonic relationship. I would have preferred if 
it stayed that way and hinted at the start of a romance at the very end.
 Not only would it have made more sense, but it would have also been 
thematically appropriate. It wouldn’t have detracted from the plot 
either; you can indeed care deeply about someone without falling in love
 with them. There was even a scene of unconscious realization of love 
that I thought was stupid. Maybe instead of having a character cry and 
wonder about it, they could have spent that time showing them blushing 
at something the other character wrote to them. Even one instance of 
this would have been more sensible than none. I don’t buy the angle 
“it’s a movie, so they don’t have enough time to show development”. Yes 
they can. Maybe remove one of three scenes in which one of the main 
characters is groping boobs and replace it with actual character 
development. It’s not that hard! 



Next, one of the main characters basically has to convince their friends
 to destroy public property in order to prevent the tragedy that only 
the main character knows is going to happen. One friend straight up says
 that’s a crime… and then casually goes along with it? The other friend 
was built up to believe in conspiracy theories, but was not provided any
 convincing evidence to readily agree to committing domestic terrorism 
and potentially damaging the reputation of his father’s company. There 
was even a lighthearted montage leading up to the plan.



Furthermore, I was not a fan of the cringy dialogue between Taki and 
Mitsuha. There is a key scene in which they are supposed to have a 
quirky teenager conversation highlighting their relationship. Instead, 
it comes off as jarring and inappropriate for the time and place, 
considering the tragedy is about to occur and they are bantering about 
groping boobs.  



- Emotional impact. I laughed two times, once because something was 
stupid and the other time I thought something was genuinely funny. I was
 either neutral or negative (thinking “this is 
stupid/necessary/nonsensical"") towards everything else. The movie lacked
 true catharsis or buildup. I think the only great cut was in the first 
third of the movie before the first song started playing. For the 
reasons discussed in the Writing section, I felt nothing during the 
scene that is commonly regarded as the most emotional point of the 
movie. The reaction that the film wanted to elicit from me was not 
justified.
        ",4
30,elmonosuke,"Have you ever watched a Cristopher Nolan movie? This is what you'll find
 with Kimi no Na Wa. A beautiful, but, yet empty movie, which hides how 
dreadful it is overall behind the fact that it's so beautiful.



The character development is inexistent, as with all Makoto Shinkai 
works, so as the reasoning of them, that should be the thing that drives
 the plot forward.



You can't actually relate with the characters, since the astonishing 
environment makes you think they're not having any issues at all.



Unless you're in a web-relationship and REALLY needs this to make a statement for you ""lover"", this is not for you.

31,Trolls_Bane,"I can see what all the hype is about, it was a meticulously put-together film, the imagery exceeds expectations although I didn't quite like the montage bits. It is beyond amazing to see how a poor and confusing concept can be so well-executed. I might have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so universally acclaimed but I am not sure, the story is really beyond awful. The characters mediocre. I guess it's really what you are looking for in a film because the animations, the atmosphere, really makes you forget all of its flaws almost instantly.",6
32,Flawfinder,"With the exception of maybe Dokyuusei, I can't think of a single original anime movie in recent times that has gotten as much fanfare as Makoto Shinkai's latest work did before it became available to the gaijin public. Even before it arrived in Japanese theatres, the fanbase that erupted from its exclusive Anime Expo-showing have been making their voices louder than a Siberian tiger scratching the world's largest chalkboard. And now that it has arrived in the Eastern theatres, it's made more money on its opening weekend than The Nice Guys had during its entire box office run. Whilst its currently high MAL score is almost guaranteed to go down once it reaches the wider audience that is America's toxic anime fanbase, the fact remains that Shinkai has really hit the big leagues as of late, and as one of anime's last remaining auteurs (let alone one that's actually good), I think that alone should be worth celebrating.

Will he become the next Miyazaki as time goes on? I don't know, and quite frankly I doubt he cares, so why should I? This isn't a review of his career anyways. It's a review of Your Name, or Kimi no Na wa as the weeaboos like to call it, and I was really looking forward to watching this one once I discovered that the premise was about a boy and a girl going through a Freaky Friday routine, because that's usually the kind of premise reserved for a cheap harem anime or One Piece. Not something you'd expect a man of Shinkai's caliber to do, and especially not a premise deserving of so much visual porn that it'd make art students cum within five seconds of exposure. Sure when you think about it, it's not too far out of his domain. Shinkai has dabbled with putting a serious take on wacky anime premises in the past (his first major work was basically a modern take on Gunbuster after all). Still, I never really expected this sort of premise to get a big-budget treatment in general unless it was a cheap franchise movie, let alone be put in the hands of such a talented guy. And now that I've seen the result of that combination, I can safely say I should never underestimate this dude.

Now before going on, I should point out that I'm fully aware most of you guys haven't had a chance to see the movie as of this time of writing, and unfortunately I can't talk about the majority of Your Name's story because of how heavily dependent it is on things not being as clear-cut as they seem. That's right. A movie about a boy and a girl who can swap bodies with each other has a lot going on underneath the surface that I can't spoil for fear of ruining your enjoyment like all of pop culture does for Citizen Kane. So let's just start off by saying that I do recommend Your Name. It's easily one of the best anime I've seen this year (not that the competition has been all that fierce) as well as one of the most emotional roller coasters that I've seen this medium produce in quite a long time. Oh, and if you are even slightly interested in shipping culture, there is a 99% chance that you will consider this movie a masterpiece, because it pretty much hits every major shipping button in the book - including ones that most hardcore shippers didn't know they had. If you want a more visual representation of what I'm talking about, remember what you loved about ERASED before it went to shit. Now imagine that show never going to shit and make sure to step out of that puddle of drool and tears you just made.

The tone of Your Name is distinctively more ""anime"" than most of Shinkai's stuff. It felt like he was trying to cater more to a mainstream audience whilst not sacrificing his signature style in the process throughout the entire runtime, and if the later Persona games are anything to go by, that can really pay off if done well. And it does pay off in quite a few ways I didn't expect. The movie made me laugh a lot, even at jokes that I wouldn't normally laugh at, and the story actually progressed in a way that I wanted to see things end happily rather than the usual bittersweet closures that I generally love about this guy's take on romance. And any anime that can get that amount of investment from me is always worth my time, even if the characters themselves don't have too much going for them individually.

Having to look up their names for this review is one thing because I'm bad at remember names in general, let alone foreign ones. But if you were to ask me to describe the two leads, I wouldn't have much to say besides a normal girl who wants to be free of the traditions set on her by her family and a normal boy who just wants to get by in life. I think it was an intentional decision on Shinkai's part to make his characters ""normal"" so that we can relate to them more and they're both likable/interesting enough, but I prefer characters who have story to them first, and relatability second. And it's hard to get too invested in a character's dilemma when I'm not given a non-circumstantial reason regarding why I'd want to follow this character in the first place.

For example, the main boy's name is Taki Tachibana, and his goals in life are to get into university, get closer to his hot female co-worker at the restaurant he does part-time work in, and grope his own breasts when he suddenly discovers he has them. That's stuff you can say about any normal Joe, and whilst I can definitely relate to those issues enough to not find Taki boring, the sort of connection I can form with him from just that is limited when I'm not the one who's actually experiencing those problems first-hand. Even when the movie gets into deeper material, Taki never really experiences any emotions or problems that are particular complex to analyze. And considering Shinkai has managed to balance both the intellectual and the emotional aspects of his stories in the past, I found the heavy emphasis on the latter at the expense of the former to be kinda disappointing. Hell, even the majority of Ghibli's output after they peaked did a pretty decent job in that department. Maybe my opinion will change if I watch the movie again (and you can bet I will), but I'm just going to say right now that I liked the character presentation in 5/cm. You fanboys may call it emotionally distant. I call it the solution to you guys overrating the hell out of Holo and Lawrence's thing.

But let's move on to another aspect of Your Name I can actually talk about: the technicals. Frankly, I am quite amazed at how much Shinkai is improving in that field, especially considering how high he sets the bar with each film he does. Not only is the visual quality of the animation so stunning that it makes Garden of Words look like someone's Flash animation and the Radwimps soundtrack one of the most fun anime soundtracks I've heard in quite some time, but the way he utilizes these technicals is so masterful that it can make even the most basic of emotions expressed throughout this film feel like you've just been hit in the face and you want more because you love it. I'm really hard-pressed to come up with a cartoon that gets emotional storytelling down the way the animation in this one does, even compared to what I consider superior cartoons like Kaiba, Haibane Renmei, or a good chunk of Pixar's output. Hell, I'd need a whole other post (and a digital file of the film) just to talk about the specifics.

A lot of you guys are watching Re:Zero, right? Well let's put it like this: if White Fox's ""masterful"" direction of Subaru's bawl-fests is the equivalent of getting hit with a cannonball, Your Name's direction of the emotions constantly vibrating in its characters, setting, dialogue, and just about everything that makes up a single frame of this film is the equivalent of getting hit with a cannonball the size of Jupiter, and there are thousands more frames where that came from. It knows when to play it light. It knows when to play it heavy. It knows just the right amount to make it seem natural. And it doesn't sacrifice more important things in the process. Well okay, I just said it sacrificed some important things a few paragraphs ago. But never to the extent that I ever walked out thinking to myself ""well that was good enough"". The Boy and the Beast is an anime I consider ""good enough"". Your Name is plain good, regardless of the actual magnitude of positive feelings I have for it.

I really wish I could talk more about the plot with you guys, but I can't. Not even regarding the movie's themes, which I'm still not quite clear on myself, but I will tell you that part of the movie's plot was inspired by Japan's recent earthquake disasters. However, I only knew this because Shinkai himself told us. Otherwise, I would never have made the connection, because the ""event"" that said inspiration is based on...well let's just say depending on your suspension of disbelief, you'll consider it emotionally heart-breaking or completely arbitrary. I'm not for heavy-handed commentary or anything, but if there is a deeper meaning that I'm missing in Your Name that'd make me join on the ""masterpiece"" bandwagon with the rest of the die-hards, I really think Shinkai should have made it more obvious. After all, some anvils just need to be dropped, because otherwise you'll risk the opposite problem of people reading too much into things. There's open to interpretation, and then there's just laying out a bunch of plot elements and telling your audience to make their own story.

Don't take my word for it though. Watch the movie yourself and come to your own conclusions. Or watch it because this review has just a raised a million questions regarding what the hell could possibly be in Your Name that's making me so cryptic in regards to describing the experience. Either way works fine. Just don't get spoiled before diving in. You'll probably still enjoy the movie regardless, but there can only be one moment of discovery, and no one should have the right to take it away from you but yourself. And even then, only when you decide that you are ready.",8
33,josejota,"I've been wanting to watch this movie since it came out due to his hype, and after finalizing it, I realized it didn't have a great character development I thought it was going to have because of his popularity. The art and the sound/music is outstanding, it really gave the movie a beautiful tone. All the voice actors did a really good job and fitted well in their characters.

The concept of the movie is remarkably sweet, and the plot is interesting. It surely isn't a bad movie whatsoever, but I honestly was expecting a little more. Even tho, I did enjoyed the movie, but it's clearly overrated and not a masterpiece.",7
34,washinwithwaves,"I had the privilege to sit in the front row of the world premiere, and I can only describe this movie as utterly phenomenal. Makoto Shinkai has created a masterpiece. If you remember his Garden of Words, then imagine something that in my opinion is five times better (hyperbole, this will obviously vary from person to person). The movie is not simply an hour-thirty of pretty landscapes and slow burn drama-romance, like in the past. It's a masterpiece.

I never tired of the characters. They are well-developed and Shinkai does an amazing job on slowly and subtly revealing what kind of people the two main characters are. Voice actors also did an amazing job.

Something else I found enjoyable was the comedy. Which Shinkai's works usually lack. I was laughing right at the beginning and even during the parts where I thought were supposed to be serious. It is definitely his most light-hearted, feel-good work but still managed to get me crying shamefully.

The plot is quite fast-paced, something I found fresh considering how calm and quiet Shinkai's movies usually are. There were moments in the movie that felt like actually music videos, and once you watch, you will understand why. Plus, you can't really go wrong with the RADWIMPS, who created songs per Shinkai's request.

Makoto Shinkai has leaped over the successes of his previous films. He has shown us something new, and I would gladly say it's one of the best movies I have ever watched.

To those of you who skipped out on the premiere, what a tremendous shame. To those of you who are eagerly waiting, you won't be disappointed.",10
35,dumburro,"""Your name"", is one of the greatest pieces of Japanese works since the creation of sushi.

Before you read this review, I highly recommend you watch the preview and/or read the synopsis for this movie.

Kimi no na wa is a beautiful and incredible movie that seems to be successful in all categories; a movie which would interest even those who don't find the genre interesting. And while the plot idea may not excite some, the setting, characters, and the fantastic work of the director, Makoto Shinka, will cause you to experience a multitude of emotions.",9
36,seasonalanime,"So the movie that's made 11.19 million in just 2 weeks, does it deserve that income or is it just a flop. :) Well it's okay definitely an enjoyable movie but a little too fast paced at places. It's not perfect but it gets a message across.
This film is wonderfully animated of course it's a shinkai film, it's gonna sparkle. This movie tried to build suspense at the end, would they meet and remember everything?? But it felt kinda just like yay at the end without any emotions, maybe because of the pacing. Of course it was emotional when Taki was trying to save Mitsuha. But none of the characters were remarkable they we're just your average students with a scene done from freaky Friday every time they ""dream"". ⠀
So do I recommend it sure just most of the first half felt unnecessary, as it was just saying hey these are the characters. And the plummeting too fast 2nd half. If anything I will take this wonderful soundtrack away from this movie, and hey this started out like a great idea for a movie. But hey everyone has different opinions some of you will enjoy it more than I did.",7
37,SavXd,"First of all I've never written a review before so I'm sorry if I mess up or don't do something correctly. :3



Plot/Story: 3

Okay, to be honest I absolutely hated the plot, there was hardly any 
interesting and phenomenal story to it and it was extremely boring. It 
felt like the same things were happening over and over and over again 
which started getting a bit eh- I personally think the story was 
overrated. 



They didn't properly explain why they were switching bodies and what 
caused them to switch like why these specific people it could have been 
anyone else, but he was chosen to switch

          
        with her. 



Art/Animation: 8

On the other hand art was absolutely beautiful while the animation is 
just your standard animation you see in most animes, but aside that all 
the colours really complimented each other nicely and the scenery was 
drawn beautifully



Sound: 9

The sound was good and the sound track that you usually hear really went well with the movie.



Characters: 5

The character development in this anime was absolute garbage in my 
opinion, the biggest character development type thing we learnt was that
 the girl was already dead and has been for a few years which wasn't 
very surprising. I can't even remember what development the boy had 
apart from him having a job and going to school.



My Enjoyment: 4

I didn't enjoy this movie at all, at the start it was okay, but the 
story shouldn't have been needed to be told in a almost 2 hour movie 
when it could have been told in about an hour and a few minutes, I 
personally think this movie was hyped up to much for what it is. 



Overall I give this movie a 4 because it is definitely watchable and the
 animation/art  makes up for the horrible plot and character 
development.



 Thank you for taking the time to read my review.  :3",4
38,Bunney,"Your Name begins with half an hour of establishing the central 
characters; Mitsuha and Taki, as well as their daily lives at school, 
work, their relationships, and their location, highlighting their 
cultural differences most importantly. This portion of the story 
succeeded in setting up the events thereafter. For that reason, in some 
ways, this is my favourite portion of the film, which doesn't set the 
greatest precedent, and I'll get to what I mean by that, all I'll say 
for now is that a disappointing second and third act can really make a 
first act look much better than it is.



However, setting up the events

          
        of the story is essentially all it is good for, and while 
character interactions felt natural, and a lot is learned about rural 
culture vs. city culture, not a lot is learned about the main characters
 beyond their sex and their cultural differences, meaning upon entering 
act two, a lot of ground has yet to be covered. That being said, small 
intricacies both characters share, such as Mitsuha's sewing and Taki's 
drawing abilities are established briefly throughout the film, and serve
 the story rather well, but ultimately, this doesn't add to their 
overall charm or lack thereof.



The blooming of a possible romance is also lost on me because the extent
 of the pair's interaction is communicating via prompts in order to help
 them remember what happened, as well as to give them lifestyle tips 
when switched to appear normal, suggesting nothing is organic or 
meaningful, especially because none of it is remembered naturally. They 
both experience each other's daily activities, such as their work and 
interacting with their friends and family, but nothing is accomplished 
to justify any form of romantic interest between the two, it more so 
succeeds as a fish-out-of-water story, or it would if the film presented
 it as such. Shinkai wants you to feel something about the coupling of 
Taki and Mitsuha, regardless of how enigmatic and convoluted their 
situation is, which, at least to me, is not a possibility. Their 
knowledge of each other is very superficial; they have lived each 
other's lives without really knowing anything about each other beyond 
their looks, their hobbies, who they hang out with, etc. They become 
infatuated with each other without ever gaining insight into each 
other's personalities, which means the reason can be reasonably boiled 
down to adolescent hormones; the thought of being even remotely in 
contact with the opposite sex... Hey, you come up with a better 
interpretation.



It's fine though, they can just shed tears and the film can play sad 
piano music to manipulate the audience into thinking something is 
actually emotional.



Soon after act two begins, the concept of 'Musubi' is mentioned, 
referring to tying, which suggests that when something is a part of a 
person, it ties into their soul. This is information learned by Taki in 
Mitsuha's body, and is also, unfortunately, where my disappointment 
began to materialize. The reason being the use of time travel 
storytelling. This is a difficult theme to tackle, and I say this 
because I'm dumb and anything to do with time travel is not in my 
wheelhouse. This is why I could never appreciate films like Primer or 
Predestination, as much as I wanted to like those films. In fact, the 
only reason I enjoyed Steins;Gate more so than the examples given is 
because the characters were engaging and had boatloads of personality. 
Essentially, if I ever call out the inconsistencies of Your Name's logic
 beyond this point, don't bother taking it seriously, trust me.



Performances are not generally something I touch on when discussing 
anime, but in this case, I'm forced to make an exception. What I looked 
for in relation to the body switching element, initially, is whether or 
not I could distinguish one character with the other; if Mitsuha as Taki
 and vice versa is presented in a way that makes me believe they're 
different. Generally, this is successful. Mitsuha's infatuation with 
city life and her femininity shows in Taki's body language and voice, 
likewise with Taki's brutish masculinity found in Mitsuha's body 
language, as well as his adjustment and growing fascination with 
Mitsuha's family customs.



However, the problem isn't how these differences are presented, the 
problem is the what; what is presented. Whenever Taki is in his body, he
 never embodies masculinity like he does when in Mitsuha's body, this is
 merely a gender-specific placeholder representing how men should act, 
the objective being to portray a women acting like a typical man, a man 
who plays sports and is abrasive, which Taki, most certainly is not. As a
 result, how the initial body switch is presented in combination with 
what is presented is too simplistic and lazy.



Shinkai maintains his trademark crisp, albeit, shallow aesthetic, 
typically favouring an array of wide shots and highlighting scenery, as 
well as presenting nature most prominently, i.e. the sky, greenery, and 
architecture, usually bringing out the best of his visual attributes. 
However, his visual flair is also usually confined to exploring nothing 
beyond the limited capabilities of reality. Never does Shinkai seem to 
separate from his stylistic comfort zone and/or implement visual 
experimentation, which would be fine and appropriate under exceptional 
circumstances, For example, his previous projects; Wolf Children and The
 Garden of Words, are narratively true to reality (except maybe for the 
actual wolf people but I digress), and the mundane, dry visuals 
compliment the narrative quite well. In Your Name, the theme of time 
travel and bodily connectivity could have benefited from the same 
complimentary visuals a film like Summer Wars had with its universe, and
 Summer Wars had more personality as a result. While Your Name looks 
fantastic in terms of production, its creativity and visual/narrative 
chemistry is lacking for the most part, though their are brief occasions
 of flair.



Furthermore, you may have noticed I coupled 'crisp' and 'shallow' to 
describe Shinkai's aesthetic, believing his previous work had more 
visual profundity, I feel confident in saying Shinkai's previous work, 
and Your Name respectively, is a concoction of beautiful and 
lightweight. Whenever Your Name cuts to a shot of, say, birds flying 
from the trees, I feel very little emotion. It feels, not so much like a
 creative decision to improve a scene, but like an overt boast, as if to
 prove to his contemporaries that he can be a legitimate filmmaker, too,
 guys. He tried too hard, which is emblematic of the kind of director 
Shinkai is. Sometimes, less is more, quite the double-edged sword 
considering I criticized Your Name for being stylistically lacking.

39,zigzag20,"Characters are mediocre at best in an story that seems interesting but quickly becomes ANOTHER poor explained and simplistic TT story. It´s decent and enjojable, and the art and music elevates the whole package, but nothing more.

A big disapointment because people refers at it as one of the best animation movies ever, but it couldn´t shake my feelings at all and his developement wasn´t solid.

Yeah, it has a few good moments and the BSO adds some, but when you are talking about the most popular anime movie in years and you got those terrible characters that i didn´t care about, i can´t elevate the grade more than a C+.

Simple but with a good package.",6
40,ndsempai,"TL DR review: Solid all around romance movie. Not Shinkai's best but comes a close second. A Must watch.

Section wise review:
Story:
Its a Shinkai film, meaning there will be a love story with a twist. 5cm/second had themes of love and effect distance can have over it. Garden of words had love between a student and his teacher while in Place promised, childhood friends took different paths as time progressed but were drawn back by a promise made during their early years.

Here we have a love story which starts off with body swapping but eventually becomes across different time periods. Its told in a sort of a non-linear way. The closest film I can think of with a similar plot is the Sandra Bullock starring Premonition.

Art:
It's a Shinkai film. That really should be certificate enough. The scenes are dripping with detail. Shinkai has a knack of taking everyday, normal stuff and making them seem magical. A simple train ride can be made to appear to be out of a fantasy setting and here it is no different. There is a section in the story called ""Kuchikamizake Trip"" which is hauntingly beautiful. Like ""making of cyborg""/parade scene in GITS/Innocence or the classroom destruction scene from Aku no hana, the scene stays with you long after you have seen the film.

Sound:
The music was an eye-opener. Music in other Shinkai's works hadnt really impressed me and I always thought of it as a weak link. No more, the songs here are truly breathtaking. Some of these songs, I will add to my playlist. My fav songs are Kuchikamizake Trip and Kataware Doki.

Character:
Here is where I feel the movie could have slightly been improved. Bear in mind that these are mostly nitpicks on my side. I feel Mitsuha got a better character arc than Taki. Taki was just some guy in Tokyo who had a crush on his sempai from work. His family status, his friends and other details about him were generally left open for interpretation. Mitsuha got a good character arc but towards the ending the entire confrontation with her father curiosly occurred off-screen. We were just told that Mitsuha's father finally believed her and got the villagers to safety. Kind of a cop-out IMO. It wasnt organic.

Enjoyment:
Nothing to complain here. Strangely I even liked the usually jarring j-pop songs Shinkai uses in his films.

Overall:
It doesnt approach the greatness of subtle storytelling that 5cm/second employed but in terms of Shinkai's works, it is a very, very close second.",8
41,Mutefrog,"Haha, yet another example of all beauty with no substance,



Your Name is quite a mess of a movie, random things unexplained, plot holes, stale characters, the list goes on. 



The best words to describe this movie is, anti-climatic. Every impactful
 moment involving Taki and Mitsuha feels like absolutely nothing to me 
because their situation involves 0 personal interaction causing me to be
 in disbelief on how they fell in love. I understand you care about him 
 but I just don't get why? This would have been easily done better if it
 was just a friendship instead of biting of more than you can chew

          
        and making it a romance. But since it's a girl and a guy, you 
can't have that. The romance is just completely unbelievable to me. I'm 
not sure how anyone actually thinks 2 people can fall in love like that.
 They had 0 chemistry, the writers just sorta, shoved them together. It 
makes more sense for them to care about their friends and family more 
than each other because those are the people they actually interacted 
with. 



The characters are quite flat and so are their relationships, you don't 
get much of their outside relationships except for meaningless 
interactions between other characters. The only characters who didn't 
suffer from this issue were Mitsuha's friends and that one chic Taki has
 a crush on, but even her character was barely meaningful to the story 
or her relationship with Taki. Taki's dad was just forgotten about and 
so were Mitsuha's other friends. I'm not sure why they added all these 
characters to barely do anything with them. From Taki's side, it seems 
like they were going to do something with these side characters but 
nope. You could have left them as just a snapshot of Taki's 
relationships and outside life, no need for them to get so close to the 
plot. I could understand the abundance of out of place characters if 
they did something to develop the main characters but no, they just took
 a back seat and nothing else for most of the movie. 



Mitsuha's family were severely underused, and we don't get much of 
Mitsuha's relationship with her father so I don't care when she 
eventually stands up to him. Grandma and Sister are there...yeah. 
Mitsuha's friend were kinda cool tho, they actually did something and 
interacted with the main characters. 



There's just too many things this movie wanted to do involving 
relationships, Taki's relationship with the hot chick was just there I 
guess, his 2 friends were there I guess. Mitsuha's relationship with her
 grandma and sister were there and her relationship with her dad was 
there too, barely. At this point, just drop all these relationships 
since you want to focus on the main 2 characters so damn bad, you can't 
do both. 



Taki is just the boring default protagonist that every person that 
identifies as a man can relate to. It's getting old. This character is a
 virgin who can be slightly anxious sometimes but can also can solve 
everyone's problems because they're the heroin. Taki stays completely 
static through out the entire movie, no change, no character 
development. He's boring to say the least. Mitsuha is slightly better 
written, she's your basic cute timid girl than any boy could fall for. 
She has character development [if you squint really hard] involving her 
dad which was sadly, once again, barely touched on. 



There are a lot of plot holes and unexplained plot points throughout 
this movie. First of all, you're telling me Matsuhi, nor Taki were aware
 of the dates?? Like, did Matsuhi not check Taki's phone and saw a 
different date than she was aware of. Did Taki never write the date on 
his homework while in Matsuhi's body? What are these random amnesia 
moments they keep having. Hello? This just seems like they did it as a 
plot device to raise the stakes. How come Matsuhi drinking homegirl's 
spit gave him some visions? We're just gonna pass this off as magic spit
 necessary to get the plot going? yes? okay. How did they switch bodies 
while still awake. I thought they could only did it when they fell 
alseep, that's how the story set it up as. You have to have a set of 
rules involving magical supernatural situations like this, it keeps the 
story grounded. You can't have random sh1t just happen for no reason, 
this just makes it so that anything is possible, reducing the stakes.



The climax of the story was quite anti-climatic. They just sorta did a 
360 and finally decided to reveal the obviously coming major plot point.
 I feel like they should have left clues showing the viewer something 
was off, building up to the reveal instead of just saying ""OMg she was 
dead from the start. wild! Isn't that CRAZYYYYYY"" like we're 5, There's a
 load of missed opportunities to improve the storytelling in general.



The animation was disappointing to say the least, yes it's pretty but 
the animation itself is boring. Take this for example, loads of recent 
disney movies have these gorgeous hyperrealistic backgrounds, but... 
it's boring. Now take Spiderman Into- the Spiderverse. The backgrounds 
are more inventive, different, interesting, creative. It just has more 
personality, it's own feel. Your Name just looks nice, that's it, ya 
know?  The way characters move are boring too, the only thing I'll 
praise it for is how they show Mitsuha's more feminine mannerism through
 Taki's body. I thought that was pretty cool. Everything else, meh. Oh 
and there's the red string, super deep right? Never seen that before.",4

And while the plot idea may not excite some, the setting, characters, and the fantastic work of the director, Makoto Shinka, will cause you to experience a multitude of emotions.",10
43,ANT4,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS



Kimi no na wa. is the highest rated movie on MAL with a score of 9.13. A
 lot of people were amazed by this movie, but I have a lot of reasons 
which made me hate this movie.



Reason no. 1:Plotholes

The movie is about two people swapping bodies, but they do not live in 
the same moment. They are born the same year, but Mitsuha is 3 years 
older. When they swap bodies they leave each other notes on their 
phones. THEY WERE CONSTANTLY ON THEIR PHONES AND THEY NEVER CHECKED THE

Another plothole is the fact that the bodyswap was never explained

          
        and Shinkai never told us what was the cause of the bodyswap!



Reason no. 2:Melodrama

The movie is forcing emotions on the audience way too much. Every scene 
which is supposed to be emotional is succeeded by a song. This was 
annoying because it was interrupting the movie constantly! 



Reason no.3:Pace

The first 50 minutes of the movie is about their experiences in other 
person's body! That is almost half of the entire film! Next 40 minutes 
are about Taki searching for Mitsuha and trying to save her life. They 
meet near the end and get separated very quickly out of an unknown 
reason.



A lot of people probably liked this movie because it blends romance, 
teenagers and time travel together. This movie is perfect for any Otaku.

I recommend the movie to you if you like to shut your brain off and 
accept every single fact thrown at you during the movie and just enjoy 
the beautiful visuals.",3
44,LorkDryos,"Genuinely don't understand the hype. It was very pretty, but the story was the most generic done-to-death romance story in which nothing really happened and continued to not really happen and then it was over after a really cheesy ""Can I ask... your name!?!?"" line.

I honestly couldn't tell you a single thing about any of the characters personalities because they had none, other than teehee boy gropes his own boobies.

The art style was very good and the sound design also was. I didn't really care for the pop songs in OST for the most part though, but that is a personal taste thing. You can tell a lot of production value went into these both, shame about the unintuitive story.",6
45,telerabies,"When anime is overtly trying to be realistic and cinematic, the lines between cinema and anime are further blurred. This might be a good thing for the wider reception of anime in cinemas (especially outside Japan) but not necessarily a good thing because 'anime' starts to take the medium itself too seriously.

Each scene is 'crafted' to look great in the isolated frame and it does demonstrate the animation technologies of Makoto Shinkai's anime movies - from Byōsoku Go Senchimētoru to Kotonoha no Niwa. This is not to blame Makoto Shinkai and his amazing achievement as an animator, editor and cinematographer, but not as a storyteller. Cliches are not necessarily a problem when you have excellent storytelling skills but your name is definitely not one of them.",6
46,Sin_the_Demon,"This movie is a beautiful looking cliché movie. Your Name is a movie 
that is supposed to make you feel for the characters and feel all these 
sort of emotions that coincide with a romance anime. But this movie 
doesn’t give me any sort of feeling for the characters and how they are 
meant to save the girl and her town before it gets destroyed and kills 
everyone. I really had wanted to like this movie but I couldn’t.



The Story: 2.

The story of Your Name is unique concept but that doesn’t change that it’s a clichéd mess of a story. The Main male, Taki, has

          
        to save this girl, Mitsuha, and her town, Itomori, from a comet 
that crashed into the town but Taki and Mitsuha change bodies. Even with
 how neat the description sounds, Your Name just wasn’t able to keep up 
with it and relied too much on the romance aspect of the movie for way 
too long. It got good towards the end when they actually helped save 
Mitsuha and the whole town’s people but then they ruined it by having a 
cliché ending, Taki and Mitsuba meet up once again and then Taki gives 
back Mitsuba’s yarn, He could have worked the ending to be less clichéd 
but he didn’t.



The Art: 8

The artwork in this movie is really good. It’s drawn, coloured and 
animated super well and it’s so beautiful. The production quality of 
this movie is very good and the choice of colours is phenomenal. 



The Sound: 7

The sound quality of this movie is really good. And the band RADWIMPS 
did a really great job on the music for this movie. The soundtrack is a 
very very good and was the most enjoyable part of this movie.



The Characters: 4

The Characters of this movie, They bothered me for most of the time 
watching this movie. Taki just felt like a creep during most of this 
movie, especially when he starts looking for her and the town where she 
lived all to find out her name so he could meet her. Mituha was a nice 
character who actually seemed to care about what was gonna happen and 
seemed really excited to go to Tokyo when she changed bodies with Taki. 
The characters that joined along side of Mitsuha, during her while 
trying to save the town, were just so annoying and forgettable. 



In the end, In my Opinion, Your Name doesn’t deserve all the hype that 
it has gotten over the 4 years since it was released. The story is just 
your typical romance, drama anime with no real weight in the Genre. The 
Art and sound were the best parts of the movie but even so, it doesn’t 
change the fact of a lackluster movie. The Characters were mostly just 
annoying and the least interesting part of the movie was the main part 
of Your Name, the Romance. The Romance between Taki and Mituha was just 
so damn boring and just a pointless part of the movie. It's a 3/10 for 
me",4
47,HarryRambod22,"I didn't outright hate this movie but I didn't like it that much either. The story and pacing weren't good and even though this movie was only an hour and forty six minutes long it felt much longer due to the unconvincing story and dry characters. This movie is like vanilla ice cream it's edible but is it the be-all and end-all of food? Not a chance. What I enjoyed about this movie were the great visuals. Everything looked stunning and was pretty to look at. The issue is though none of it had much substance. Makoto Shinkai basically created a visual movie (maybe drawing tutorial). The visuals are beautiful and nice to look at but is there really any substance behind it? Makoto Shinkai is definitely no Miyazaki, Kawajiri, or Satoshi Kon (RIP). Good artwork but he needs to focus on making interesting characters for a story like this to work which he didn't. Maybe I came in with too high expectations? That is possible but for such a highly rated and acclaimed film I just didn’t think it was all that special or exciting.",6
48,Rikuson1,"This movie was a good movie for people that like slice of life and stories in the realm of freaky friday, or body switchers should I say would get a kick out of this one, it was the plot twist in the middle that kept me going to see how it was going to end. Now I probably would have rated this higher if it went for an end that I didn't see coming or at least go for an ending that wasn't so should I say ""lazy, easy and safe""? Nothing wrong with safe, sure but you don't get any extra points by me with such a lazy ending, this is 2016 with a ton of inspirational and good story telling to pull from. Mediocre endings have been really urking me lately and it doesn't help that this fell into that point was unsatisfactory. Yeah I know this is fiction but at the end of the day you have to put some attempt to make sense of the rules of the fictional world you have created Kimi No Nawa gave no fucks when it came to explaining what the supernatural rules to the alternate timeline/dimension body switching crap it introduced. They showed us patterns on how it works then by the 80% point it stopped giving a fuck for the sake of making the audience feel for the plot in an emotional way. I can't get down with such a sloppy conclusion just to make sure the the to main characters end up with each other. Far too many questions, it seem like the writers just want you to stop thinking and just embrace your simp like emotions, cry like a bitch at how debatably touching these scenes are and give me a 10/10 because I made you cry. No.. you are a good movie but you are not a very good movie in my eyes Kimi No Nawa you have far too many flaws that i can't let you ride out with.",7

i saw this film cuz of the hype surrounding and for that rating but it 
doesn't desever that at all (i know so many people liked it but i dont 
care)

story :- the story is not like something that comes in a decade or comes
 by acheiving masterclass in writing . it's just plain and simple and 
those who are more into anime can expect what happens next. At first i 
thought concept is different but it lost track so easily



Art :- Art really deserves good marks. the only aspect i enjoyed



Sound :- it's not clearly audible and

          
        sometimes sound doesn't do a good job here. but sometimes its better to add it when the scenes are intense.



Character :- during the 1st half characters are like great. but they get their graph falling , falling and falling.



enjoyment :- YUP, I SUCCESSFULLY WASTED A nearly 2 hours for this film.



OVERALL :- those who  are new into anime and are not picky then go watch
 this. but those experts out there, its just a same old ass story

50,Yorozuya4eva,"I have to make it clear I don't believe that this movie deserves the hype it's been given, that was probably one of the reasons I was so disappointed when watching this. That being said the movie is by no means excruciating to watch and the basic idea behind the story is not too shabby so if you have time and you're able to just watch it with no expectations good on you, watch it, you'll probably enjoy this more than I did.",7
51,Katecof,"The movie is mediocre, I can appreciate the animation and the art direction, and we can also say that the way the story rolls is pretty interesting, the characters meet each other by switching body's and living the life of each other... but how exactly am I suppose to believe that something like that can evolve into a romantic connection? They had been doing that to endure the situation they're involve in, there is not a plausible way to think that such a thing can happen in those circumstances, you can feel worried about your survival partner, but you can't feel the desire to be her/his boyfriend/girlfriend, at least not when you are unable to treat with that person face to face.

The time travel is another plot hole, both kids were set on different dates and none of them were able to figure that out (despite they spent like 1 or 2 weeks dealing with the problem)

The whole problem was solved thanks to the magic of the plot armor, since literally everything got solved by a miracle that came out of nowhere, and both kids were able to save the whole town because of that.

5/10 Just another disappointment.",5
52,michaelchr42,"What happens if you take the classic over-indulgent Shinkai movie, throw
 in a new sci-fi aspect, and then cram in every cliché in the book? 
Well, you’d get “Kimi no Na wa,” (“Your Name,” in English) aka the most 
overrated anime movie of the decade, and one of the most overrated 
movies period. It’s extremely difficult for me to write a review on a 
Shinkai movie without it turning into a larger rant about Shinkai and 
his poor directing, because he is invariably stuck in his own 
self-indulgent, bland formula, and “Your Name,” is no exception. The 
movie is a messy and frustrating ride of

          
        ups and downs, with some pretty art and faux-philosophical 
dialogue to trick you into thinking it’s anything above average. It’s 
Shinkai schilling out his most commercially wide-appealing, and 
tweeniest movie of all. It seriously has about as much tact as something
 like “Twilight,” or “Fifty Shades of Grey.” The movie is tweenager 
perfection; two hours of angsty pre-teen fantasies about groping a cute,
 quirky girl who eventually falls for you. It really is the anime 
equivalent of emotional escapism porn for angsty teenagers with crushes,
 just dressed up in pretty clothes to be touted as a movie of the likes 
of ”Akira,"" and ""Spirited Away.""



Now, before going deeper into my problems with “Kimi no Na wa,” I’ll 
take a moment to discuss its merits as to not make this review overly 
rant-y. The photo-realistic animation is nice, and there are some really
 good sequences throughout the film. The story improves at times and 
there are even a few emotionally resonant moments, however, the glimmers
 of greatness are hampered by horribly tacky stylistic decisions, dull 
and generic progression, along with heaps of predictable and 
overbearingly corny moments. This wouldn’t be a Shinkai picture without a
 main comedic gag based around breasts, and I kid you not Taki groping 
Mitsuha for comedic effect isn’t brought up once, not twice, not thrice,
 but five fucking times. Continuing with cringe-worthy stylistic 
decisions, the whole movie is filled with constant build-ups of piano 
music one after another that each last around 5 minutes and get 
ridiculously, and irritatingly repetitive. The song choices aren’t much 
better, as they shove multiple tacky pop songs in at random points in 
montages and emotional moments to laughable effect. The possible biggest
 offender though is the overbearingly ostentatious narration and 
dialogue. Shinkai is just a bad writer, and the voiceover’s in his 
movies are always flat-out embarrassing. The voice-overs are lame and 
superficial; they're made to sound like they hold some sort of weight at
 a glance, but upon the slightest inspection, you realize they’re really
 just boring, self-indulgent, and empty narrated monologues. 



“Kimi no Na wa,” wanted to be many things, and had some legitimately 
interesting thematic directions, but ultimately fails at realizing any 
of them. Shinkai tries to convince you that Mitsuha and Taki have a 
significant and even transcendent bond, but he doesn’t actually lend 
anything real to it. Music and visuals are the movie’s crutch, all the 
emotion, and supposed bond between Mitsuha and Taki are carried by the 
pretty pictures and boo-hoo sad music, without actually holding weight. 
The movie had so many potential thematic routes that it just never 
explores, it scratches the surface of being about family, or the 
intangibility of human connection, or bonds threaded by dreams and 
underlying, but overpowering feelings. It could’ve gone in so many 
directions, but instead, it just crumbles under a generic and seemingly 
endlessly repetitive narrative. Funny enough, I think Shinkai has gotten
 worse as a director over time as his earlier, shorter work is his 
strongest in my eyes. “Your Name,” would’ve seriously benefitted from 
the more intuitive, emotional work of his earlier career, and I’m 
starting to believe that Shinkai should just go back to short films, or 
hire a writer and focus on visuals. To speak one more praise to “Kimi no
 Na wa,” I have to mention the kuchikamikaze drinking scene. It’s a 
beautiful and cerebral segment filled with creative visual direction and
 represents everything the movie could’ve been for me. It’s a really 
great scene that sparked thoughtful feelings in me and is easily my 
favorite part of the movie. 



Roger Ebert said, “Every great film should seem new every time you see 
it.” A favorite film is said to be one that you can rewatch and love and
 appreciate each time in possibly new ways. The opposite has been true 
for me watching “Kimi no Na wa.” My first experience with the film was 
as a 12-year-old weeb who loved it dearly and rated it a 10/10. The 
superfluous dialogue sounded smart to me, and the visuals were 
oh-so-pretty, plus the whole emotional escapism porn aspect spoke 
greatly to my insecure self with a crush. My second watch was as a 
slightly older 14 year old. On this second watch, I started to find 
problems with the movie and its overblown corniness, my score was moved 
to an 8/10. Upon third watch, I disliked it even more and moved it to a 
7/10. Recently, a few years later, I watched the movie with some friends
 marking my fourth watch, and surprise, surprise I disliked it even 
more. After getting more heavily into movies, I found ""Kimi no Na wa"" to
 simply be average. Finally, on this most recent and final rewatch I 
have solidified my opinions on the movie and give it a 4/10. I actually 
really dislike the film now, and even though I feel it realistically 
deserves something around a 5, my ratings are based on personal 
enjoyment and so my rating now sits at a 4/10. “Your Name,” sure is 
pretty, but it’s also pretty convoluted and ultimately hilariously 
overrated. ",4
53,callie_v,"I'm not a movie critic, so when I watch a movie I watch it to enjoy not 
to write a comprehensive review. And because of that, it's hard to write
 much about this movie because of how forgettable it is. 



The MC is your typical regular dude. What impressive and smart character
 design... making the character relatable to the general audience in 
order to entrance the viewers. Except it's not exciting, it's boring, 
it's been boring the first day the trope existed and it's boring now. 
It's okay to make a character a little less colorful than the other 
characters for relatability, but you can't

          
        leave an empty slate for the MC. 



The ""love"" aspect in this story is just a divine fated relationship, 
which is a shallow idea of romance in my opinion. What this story has 
going for it is the premise. It's a body swapping, time traveling blur. 
It's confusing but not interesting enough to bother to understand what's
 going on.



The time skip ending was so generic they may as well added a kiss under 
the fireworks scene as well. It felt as if they were clearly trying to 
appeal to everyone in the world and in order to do that they made the 
characters, emotion, and plot as bland as possible. This movie doesn't 
have traits that make it a bad, negative experience. It is just so bland
 to the point of painful mediocracy.

54,VelleEdge,"Kimi no Na wa is an ambitious slice of life anime packed into a marvelous movie-length bite. It is hard to believe how much character development was actually achieved and how impeccably it was done. This development was achieved, as most great character development is done: not through mindless narration but by putting the characters in particular scenarios, watching their interactions with other characters and environments, and with each other; meaning, that you're utterly bombarded with character development through the entire movie, whether you notice it or not. Every little action and reaction, every decision, every scene is specifically tailored to show you as much of the characters as possible. This is the more impressive considering how ambitious of a premise the movie has and how much plot there is to tell. And, it somehow does all of it with time to spare. The story told in the anime is full of emotional plot twists that are sure to get your heart racing, just ignore the massive plot holes everywhere. A solid pick for fans of the slice of life genre.",5
55,sg001,"What is visually beautiful is the same amount of script errors:



• Taki is not a well-developed character, he becomes forgettable when he is not in Mitsuha's body;



• With two cell phones in hand, how did they not notice that they were 
both living at different times? Especially Mitsuha when you weren't in 
Taki's body in Tokyo didn't you see any subways / trains on the banners 
and other places in the city registered in 2016? In this universe there 
are no applications? Is there no car of the year? nothing to show or 
what they live on?



• Supporting characters don't have a ""life of

          
        their own"", if I reach out to you and say we're going to explode in a bank, would you? of course not!

They are already friends of Mitsura without asking any questions, doing 
something like that, using explosives to blow up a city energy reserve, 
breaking into a radio and evacuating people just because of Mitsura said
 and also because of the script anyway they do to use a friendly ending 
to the general public;

It would be more coherent to make Mitsura convince an exchange or party 
location for a school saying that it would be more comfortable for 
everyone, as it causes a more defined space and the like, does not do 
all this maracutaia above to give an ""excitement"" in the anime;



• A reaction from the character Okudera, Miki bothers me a lot for not 
being natural, imagine how to call your girlfriend to an indoor location
 asking to remove a skirt that I will calculate in that location? It is 
obvious that she could not take the same out if she were gay because she
 was not intimate with her, but also question me why a restaurant has 
different colored threads and a sewing needle?

And another point, why doesn't this restaurant have clothes reserved for
 its employees? we know that because of the hustle and bustle as waiters
 sometimes get dirty like clothes and that there is always a reserved 
outfit so that it does not give an impression to customers in 
restaurants;",1

'gorgeous' animation effect was only good in the first quarter or so. 



a summary would be; a bunch of hopeless clips put together in hopes of 
moving the audience with some arguably nice backgrounds and decent music

there was nothing memorable from this except my frustration and the need to just get to

of forcing so many disastrous plot holes. their meeting, connection and 
love made no sense at all. honestly, they themselves made no sense, were
 they even real? they were created in such a way that they looked like 
cardboard cut outs to me. their nonexistence dialogue was boring and 
their interaction? lacking depth and emotions.

have a gender swap and they help each other BUT the most annoying is how
 they fell in love. Like a moment ago theyre just helping each other and
 then suddenly they fell in love with even metting each other? Their 
love story seems forced and the anime fails to deliver a story where 
viewers can feel that the love

62,TurnoverHD,"Your name is a film that thrives on simplicity, but it doesent go as far with it as i hoped.
its a film that does things that other, big budget movies LOVE to do.
trick your brain into thinking the movie appeals to you when it really appeals to everyone.
Just like Marvel films, and some other anime films, Your name does alot of things in an attempt to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. it never goes far into one genre, wallowing in sci-fi, comedy, romance, and slice of life specifically, and as a fan of all these genres it would appeal to me on paper, right?
exactly.
by having such a broad appeal, Your Name fails to inject any uniqueness into the film. and while Your Name is said to make people cry, my eyes were dry as bone. it is by no means a terrible movie, just like some marvel films and anime, it feels unfair to say it isnt good, it is good. but unlike some truly great peices of media, it doesent want to appeal to a specific audience, afraid of insulting other ones.
this is why it made so much money, because it uses a trick that i hate. make the film broad and samey in order to maximise profits. i liked the film, but i felt manipulated or shoved in a certain direction. I originally watched this film expecting the body swapping to remain the main plot point, but i got too much of too little. And thats why its a 6. its Art is amazing, and the studio probably neglected alot of animators to make it that good, the sound design is nice, but it lacks identity. i enjoyed the characters, but only because there wasnt a reason to hate them or love them, they didnt appeal to me or turn me off in the same way the plot does.
in my opinion, characters make the story, and plot is super important in any peice of media. and by having such a broad range of appeal, it ticked the popularity box, but its sadly shallow and unassuming. it avoids any risks and plays it safe. i dont regret watching it, but i wont be again",6

If you are searching for something not just good, but original, you will want to cry. This is hard to give a grade, because it's one of this popular thing that is neither bad, good or between the two. It's perfect for entertainment and fast romance emotion.

The colorful and vibrant visuals plus the character development and hilarious drama really impressed me, and I was understanding why it was so widely loved. However, the more I watched after the first half, the less I started to like it. The silly atmosphere went away, and it became a lot more serious than I feel it needed to. It seems like every modern show just feels the need to have some special meaning behind it, and ends up making your head hurt out of confusion. Even if they felt it necessary to have it take a serious and life threatening route, I think they could've done it in a way that made more sense. I've seen countless people on forums who are just trying to understand the canon story. I know some people like the mystery of them not ""shoving the plot in your face,"" but when I watch a movie, TV show, anime, or really any form of media, I don't want to stress myself out just trying to understand it.

Or Plot turns, in my humble opinion.

I defy you tell me the tone and ending of this movie's and 5 Cm/s was any different! Judging by this movie, Japan still is a country of adults stuck in arrested development with no future and pathetic social skills just waiting for the world to end. SAD! (And perhaps BAD?)",5

So many inconsistencies and head scratchers and so many unanswered questions that the movie just never seemed to think about. Worth watching for the visuals but don't expect a story or characters on the level of something like A Silent Voice because you won't be getting one.

First Story,the plot was suited for a film and I really enjoyed the suspense they kept till the end. There were major twists halfway. If you are a pure shounen fan u might not like it for your taste, but the beautiful animation will make up for it.
And there's a bit of scifi here like parallel universes so it might be hard to figure it out but u will get it.
Art here is the key selling point, now I haven't watched other movies like this but at the start I was amazed by its crystal clear art, with detail in every aspect displayed beautifully. Say it cutting tomatoes or shooting comets every thing is done the right way and id rewatch this film just for the animation. Well done in that aspect.

Coming to sound, now I am no audiophile, but sound is just as well done as animation. If u wear headphones or use surround sound, you can really feel the immersive feel of being with the characters and watching their point of view. of course this is made to stream on theatres so u can understand. Soundtrack was great, its soothing ending song gave it a perfect satisfying knack to it, and I am glad I didn't skip the PC scenes(post cred.)

Character-wise except MC and heroine, the supporting characters didn't play much role in the plot, they were there just for plot sake. Didnt really make an impact. Since the movie is focused only on those two , can't really complain. Also the VA is done well, I appreciate their efforts.

Overall I enjoyed the movie and I would rewatch it just for animation. And I really liked how the plot narrates from characters point of view and both the animation and sound made it feel like I was right in the middle of the story, that's how impressed I was with the film, and btw I was never a fan of romance tag, so don't watch it with such prejudice, and trust me after watching this film, you will feel satisfied.",10
70,myronator,"Makoto Shinkai is a director that clearly loves the idea of 
""star-crossed lovers"", ""love at first sight"" and the idea that once you 
fall in love, even as children, that you will be dedicated to that 
person forever even if circumstances change or the people in love 
change. In most of his previous films the characters fall in love 
instantly and we spend the rest of the film watching them pine over the 
other wishing that they could be together, even if decades have gone by 
without being in contact with each other. The clearest example of this 
is in 5cm Per Second where the

          
        protagonist simply cannot move on from a crush he had as a child
 on a close friend. Nevertheless, in The Garden of Words, there was a 
sense of growth in Shinkai as we get to actually see the main characters
 develop their relationship on screen. But, it still ends in the same 
way as the other Shinkai films with the protagonist pining for his lost 
love. I had hope that Shinkai would build on this growth with Your Name,
 to give even more depth and understanding of romance and love, however 
all this film gave me was disappointment.



Before delving into this disappointment, I want to mention the 
outstanding animation, backgrounds and sound design in Your Name. This 
is perhaps the cleanest looking film I've seen thus far. It is easy to 
be absorbed into the world of Your Name due to how well the film is 
presented. I would argue that Your Name is even better than 5cm Per 
Second in terms of visuals.



Now, while I could go on about the visuals, at the end of the day the 
purpose of these visuals is to tell a story, and here the story fails. 
On the surface, the initial plot to Your Name seems like it could work. 
The trailers covered the first half of the story, where the characters 
have to overcome their predicament of switching bodies every so often. 
Then comes the plot twist and from there, everything falls apart. 



SPOILERS FROM HERE



Somehow, these characters are not only switching bodies, but they are 
also traveling through time. Yet, somehow they never realise they are 
traveling through time. This makes no sense at all. The characters would
 have picked up on this almost immediately through simply looking at 
their phones. But no, we're meant to believe that these characters are 
that stupid that they didn't realise what the date was every time they 
switched bodies. Both characters are then surprised when they try to 
find the other and notice the time difference. Mitsuha doesn't even 
question the idea that Taki is a few years younger in her timeline. This
 leads to the crisis where they need to change the past to save 
Mitsuha's town. 



The rest of the film dealing with the evacuation of the town is 
ridiculous. At the very least they could have had a scene where Mitsuha 
opens up to her friends about the whole time travel thing to make things
 feel a bit more grounded, but instead they jump straight in to blowing 
up the power plant. The main conversation that is meant to convince the 
mayor to evacuate the town is done off screen, so we don't even get to 
see how Mitsuha has grown as a character in standing up to her father. 
Nevertheless, this is not as poorly handled as the main story of the 
film; the romance between our protagonists.



The biggest question I have for this film is this; at what point do 
these characters fall in love? During the first half of Your Name they 
are casually dealing with the body switching problem, then during the 
second half of the film they're in love. At no point do we get to see 
them doing anything that would lead to any romantic feelings developing.
 The only explanation we have is the usual for Shinkai; that they were 
destined to be in love even if they barely know each other. The worst 
part of this portrayal of romance is that when they finally get to have a
 discussion with each other, Taki just writes ""I love you"" on Mitsuha's 
hand instead of his god damn name so she can't even remember who he is. 
Then we're meant to assume that many years later, even after forgetting 
all the events that happened, that these two characters were waiting for
 each other to fall in love again. These people barely know each other, 
have almost no chemistry, and what they did learn about each other they 
forgot due to amnesia. It seems like Shinkai read Romeo and Juliet and 
assumed that's how a successful romantic relationship works and 
completely missed the point that its a tragedy about stupid teenagers 
making terrible decisions because they decided they are in love after 
barely knowing each other. 



It seems that Shinkai still has no idea how relationships work. Your 
Name falls in to the same category as the rest of his films where the 
main characters are in love forever and we're meant to feel sad when 
they long for each other for years/decades. This view is simply too 
naive to be taken seriously. I can't recommend this to anyone unless you
 view love like Shinkai does. 
        ",3
71,Dante012,"Okay, I'm pretty sure anyone seeing this score would be shocked. To be 
honest, I was shocked first, by how popular this movie is. Today, 
everyone knows about Your Name. It was such a huge hit, even outside 
Japan. But really, aside from the visuals, there is literally nothing 
worth mentioning.





STORY

Everyone had this thought once : ""I wish I had a chance to change my 
life!"". This movie plays on that, by showing the story of two young 
people (a boy and a girl) who somehow switch with one another and live 
the other's life. First confused, they then get a hold of the situation

          
        and even manage to communicate through written messages, thus organizing their weird life.

Then, the story takes a dramatic turn when we learn that a comet is 
coming and may erase an entire town from the surface of the Earth (and 
as it happens, this is the village of one of the MCs).



So, what's wrong with that?

- First, I hate it when a story has two different plots but these aren't
 really linked with each other. Whenever the two stories can be taken 
separately, it means it failed to merge together. If you have to make 
several stories into one, make sure they converge in a coherent way.

- Then, I know it's just a story and I may be overthinking it, but the 
story as it is told is just full of plot holes, which make it totally 
unbelievable. Long story short : THERE IS NO ANSWER TO ANY MYSTERY. Why 
are these two people switching places? What exactly is this comet? Why 
does any of this happen? Basically, everything happens because DESTINY. 
And that's all. Everything is bound to happen, so it happens, end of 
story.

- Finally, worst of all : the love story is not believable at all. I 
mean, those two characters wind up falling in love, but they haven't 
even met!





ART

On that point, there isn't anything to blame. Well, I do have one thing 
to say : the animation wasn't as smooth as people pretend it is. It was 
globally clean, but there were several times where I found the motions 
quite unnatural. The same for the light effects : they were beautiful, 
but I didn't find them natural enough.





SOUND

I literally remember NOTHING, not even one track.





CHARACTER

As it is just a short movie, there is simply no time to introduce or 
develop the characters. As a result, we can't really blame the secondary
 characters for being one-dimensional and not interesting.

What I do blame is the fact that even the MCs are average. They have 
literally no particular trait. This was probably intended, so I guess 
that is not really a problem. The real problem is : since they have 
nothing particular, why would this story happen to THEM specifically? 
There's gotta be a reason for destiny to choose them, right?





ENJOYMENT

I did enjoy the visuals, but aside from that, I retain literally nothing
 from Your Name. A lot of it is way too ordinary to be interesting, and 
the parts which are unusual are full of plot holes, as the main 
mysteries are answered only by the typical answer ""sh*t up, it's 
destiny"".

That said, Your Name can be an emotional ride if you get in. I guess 
this is why it's so popular, and I (kinda) get it. I personally can't 
enjoy a story if it makes no sense.",3
72,Ezalea,"While it is visually and artistically creative and pleasing, the basic 
plot is un-enjoyably slow, and the characters are dull and 
unimaginative. I had high hopes for this after hearing all the hype 
around it, but unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. 
Maybe it's just not for me, and I can respect that, but nonetheless it 
was not an enjoyable watch.



Contrary to many people's opinion, I personally thought much of the plot
 was senseless and unnecessary. To add to this, the characters 
introduced are unimaginably dull, and their personality seems to be 
about as vibrant as a sheet of paper.",2
73,True_Scientist,"Everyone says that this is a great anime. Strongly disagree sadly, 
visuals and sounds are excellent yes, but personally I didn't enjoy the 
natural disaster based plot.



The main protagonists personality was unclear, a mix of traits that 
don't fit together or make sense.The fact that they forget in the whole 
thing makes it unbearably boring for me. 



Romance is supposedly the key point and even though romance is my 
favorite genre, didn't enjoy this one at all. Bad ending as well because
 romance didn't go anywhere,I wasn't even convinced that they love each 
other to be honest



Just all in all worse than average.



PS. Still salty

          
        about watching this. 6 weeks later.",4
74,taibles,"I know what you're thinking... you're angry that I gave your favorite 
movie a score that wasn't a 10 but before you go to my profile and write
 an angry comment saying I have a shit taste in anime please read what I
 have to say then feel free to say whatever you want. This is my first 
review on MAL so please bare with me for a few minutes as im not really 
that good at making things seem professional.



When I was going into Kimi No Na Wa I was thinking that it was going to be the second coming of christ, (considering it

          
        portrayed that way) but oh god I was wrong. And instead of 
coming out of the movie instead of being emotionally touched, I was 
actually infuriated that I had wasted my time with this piece of 
garbage.



Story - 2/10

All I can really say is that they tried.. they tried really hard to make
 this a compelling, touching, & emotional story, but the way its 
presented makes nearly everything about this movie fall flat on its 
face. The story Kimi No Na Wa is nowhere near unique, but that isn't 
really the problem that I have with it. It's more of how they poorly 
executed the story actually was, let alone the entire movie. The story 
of Kimi No Na Wa is a gender bender romance between 2 horrifically bland
 characters on how they switch bodies and how they learn to communicate 
with each other and live the life of someone of the opposite gender. 
When the story is supposed to be a roller coaster of emotions when it 
actually feels completely rushed and almost nothing about it even seems 
remotely real. They could have done a lot more and I see what they were 
trying to do with this film, but this further supports the theory that 
Makoto Shinkai completely lacks the ability to write anything 
compelling.



Art - 8/10

I mean good animation is always a plus, to be completely honest they had
 really good production. Almost everything about the art style was 
pretty in some way but that doesn't really change the fact that good 
animation cant save a poorly executed story. To be completely honest the
 animation is the only reason to watch this movie and nothing else. But 
if you're only really looking for something that has an amazing 
animation you'll probably be better if you found something else as it 
isn't hard to find things that are prettier than this.



Sound - 6/10

Not much to really say here as it doesn't really sound all that amazing 
or all that bad either. Nothing really stood out to me as that amazing 
for the sound production. The music was pretty cool I guess? But 
honestly, I can't really remember anything that was absolutely 
groundbreaking.



Characters - 2/10 

Oh boy, and the Characters where do I even start. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is 
even remotely interesting or unique about the characters in Kimi No Na 
Wa. I get that its a movie and they don't have as much time to develop 
the characters than in a normal length anime but Jesus Christ like at 
least try and make them unique. Both of the main characters are your 
average cookie cutter male and female anime protagonists. There is 
NOTHING about either of these characters that stand out. They don't have
 funny or even interesting personalities. It honestly amazes me how 
anyone can relate or even feel anything towards these characters.



My Personal Enjoyment - 1/10

I've never actually been angry after finishing something of any sort. If
 its bad then I kinda just tend to brush it off, forget about it and 
move on, but as I said earlier I was actually infuriated because of this
 sorry excuse an emotional romance film. I tried really hard to like 
this movie trust me I tried really fucking hard to enjoy it, but I 
honestly just couldn't do it. Almost everything about this movie seemed 
poorly written and rushed which led to an awful experience. And if I 
wasn't watching it with a friend I honestly would have stopped halfway 
through. And honestly, I should have instead of wasting my time when I 
could have been doing something else. 



Overall - 2/10

I don't really know what else to say the real only redeeming factor was 
that the animation was good and literally nothing else stood out. it was
 a poorly written, bland story with even more bland characters. It 
honestly baffles me on how anyone can think this is anywhere near a 
masterpiece. I wouldn't even recommend this to anyone who wants even a 
little bit of good storytelling. Maybe to people that want something 
pretty so they can turn off their brain and be distracted for 2 hours.



I only really made this review mainly because I have a really strong 
opinion on this movie as a whole and thought I had to get it out there. 
Like I said earlier though this is my first review so it would be nice 
if I could get some feedback on what I could improve on next time. Thank
 you for taking your time to read my review.",2
75,CordobezEverdeen,"This is easily one of the worst things that i watched this year.



Story: A complete mess. There are the times where the plot is beyond 
insulting when it comes to originality. I was able to predict almost 
every ""plot twist"" from miles away.

Also the movie is never clear regarding its target audience. Does the 
movie wants people who are crazy focused, people that dont try to think 
too much about the plot, people with absolutely no brain cells? Well i 
dunno so lets just put scenes that target all of those people 
individually. So yeah there are scenes that require a shit ton of focus

          
        so you dont miss anything and then there are multiple scenes of spiritual sexual harassment... ugh.

The interaction between... wait a minute. The main characters (almost) never interact with each other directly...

I'm pathetic when it comes to romance stories (that aren't the main 
atraction but rather a side story or something that is there but you 
dont have to mind too much about). Whatever crap you show me will always
 receive praise because im a sucker for it. But when it comes to a fully
 romance focused story my critic sense is on alert. Kimi no Na wa is not
 a romance story. This movie is not about romance. I cant be more clear 
about it.

There never is a reason for why these characters should care about each other at all.

Their ""interactions"" are friendly but that's about it. Aside from the 
pseudo sexual harassment (what does that mean? Well there is the dude, 
he goes into the girls body like this were some hentai anime and he 
starst grabing her chest and this happens like 5 times on screen and god
 knows how many times he did that) there is  absolutely no reason for 
these characters to have romantic feelings for each other (there is even
 a part where the girl seems to be into girls. Maybe she is bisexual i 
dunno).

There is no originality at all on the movie and when it comes to stories
 of this ""genre"" (the ones that saw the movie know what im talking 
about, mentioning it would be spoiler even though anyone with a few 
functioning brain cells could figure out the plot twist) the ammount of 
movies, shows, videogames and animes that use this and are genuinely 
good at it is inmense. 

I highly doubt that i ever saw an story of this ""genre"" that i disliked.
 How can you do something poorly with this ""genre""? Probably the most 
surprising part of the story is how poorly writen it was.

There is an insane ammount of wasted screen time where we see shots of 
Tokyo (i explain my personal disdain with this on ""Art""), some japanese 
places, random characters that arent on the show, etc (the first scene 
is justified and it comes with a nice song too but the moment is 
prolonged for too long and it quickly loses its charm).



Art: It looked cute i guess i dont have any complaint but it didnt blew my mind.

It's obvious that this movie wasn't aiming for western gaijins like me and instead it tried to catch the eye of Japan.



Sound: There is so many things wrong with this.

Imagine i dunno Friday 13, Alien or Saw. Now imagine that while some 
people are about to be dismembered or chopped in half in incredibly gory
 scenes there was some kpop song banging on the background or i dunno a 
Barbie doll song (im a barbie world in a plastic world whatever).

This is what happens on the movie. Incredibly terrifing scenes where me 
as an spectator is listening to some soothing and cute song but what's 
happening on screen doesnt match this at all.

There is such a massive ammount of bad stuff happening on the movie yet the songs never pair with those scenes properly.

Why in the world when people are going to die im listening to some 
artist giving her 100% in a cute song like everything was okay?

It's insulting. I'm a human watching this. I'm being shown that bad stuff is going to happen.

I'm not supposed to smile when bad stuff happens... what the hell Makoto Shinkai?



Characters: One word. Inconceivable. Even to anime standards.

The characters are so dumb and fake that they take you away from enjoying the ride.

Their reactions are so incredibly cliche. Unless you were born yesterday
 there is absolutely no way that you can be surprised by their answers 
or reactions.

The main cast is so poorly written and their horrible voice acting 
doesnt help (there are a few screams here and there but it feels like 
they were playing some online game at 3 AM so they cant rise their voice
 or their parents will scold them... what the hell? Scream harder! It is
 so infuriating.).

A few of the characters reaction seem to point out at new side stories 
but they never go anywhere. The thing is that this movie last almost 2 
hours but the actual movie lasts for 40 mins at best so its not like 
there was no extra time to be spent into polishing the main story or 
presenting the side stories or doing anything. 

There is a massive ammount of ""wasted"" screen time (im not complaining 
about a few scenes here and there showing the scenery but jesus christ i
 almost fell asleep a few times for how predictable or slow everything 
was going. I even considered playing Pokemon on my phone a couple of 
times since absolutely nothing that was being shown on screen was 
surprising me, not even a tiny bit).



Enjoyment: If the movie lasted for i dunno 1 hour i could have enjoyed it a little bit more.

I want the time i wasted watching this mess back. There was absolutely nothing that i enjoyed of this movie.

Well i liked the few scenes where we see the kitchen of a restaurant but i work at one so im pretty sure that was the reason.

Don't waste your time.





Final thougts: I cant think of nothing that makes this movie worth watching.

It's not sad, it cant evoke my feelings (""When this is going to get 
good?"" doesnt count) nor it can make me cry (it's not hard! In less than
 5 minutes a show like i dunno BNHA with no build up whatsoever was able
 to make me cry twice. So it's not like you need a shit ton of time 
building a house of cards to make me feel sad).

I feel that this could have worked better as an anime and a movie cannot
 properly present the story (that is not good on any level but at the 
very least it could have been properly shown right?).

The songs felt so unnecesary 90% of the time and from that % a big chunk could be classified as insulting.

Even the damn SAO the worst story ever made wasnt as poorly written as Kimi no Na wa.

I'm comparing SAO to Kimi no Na wa? Yeah

Well what more do you expect from this review... i really wanted to like this. Seriously.

But it was a complete waste of time.



edit Afterthoughts: I might sound like im deeply concerned about 
originality when it comes to stories but that couldnt be more wrong.

If a story is well written and well presented it doesnt matter if its originality its crap.

I love Black Clover and that show is a lot of things but original. I 
feel like i had the necesity to point this on the end. Originality is 
never a problem when i look at some anime. When something its unoriginal
 and absolute garbage then it's like it adds salt to the wound but thats
 pretty much it.

Kimi no Na wa is terrible but being unoriginal just makes the story it tries to tell even worse.

76,JefferyThegreat,"This is my first ever review on myanimelist but Kimi no Na wa is honestly one of the best anime movies I have ever seen. The beginning of the film was a bit confusing for me and I nearly fell asleep when I was watching the film but there was a certain scene that woke up, that scene gave me happiness about the true meaning of love and this movie shows every single aspect of that. I really enjoyed watching this film, there was also a bit of funny scenes during the movie but the best part of this film was the music that was used during some scenes and man it got me into the feels train. I love the two protagonists of the film ( Mitsuha and Taki) because through these two it gave me hope about what love is all about, that even when time passes by, your feelings for the person you love will never go away, your incomplete without them. This is a must watch movie before you die, it's so sweet and overall it's a masterpiece that's gonna be in my top 5 for the best animes I've seen.

I highly recommend that you guys actually give this a chance because this movie for me is a 10/10 and this is a really good movie for all my romance lovers out there. This is my first review and I hope this encourages someone to watch it because its just really good. Sorry if I wasn't in depth with my review, Im just trying my best and this is also my first time lol",10
77,Malzakiel,"Kimi no na wa is a great exemple of what a good anime movie should be. The visual art is well done and the SFX are outstanding. One thing I liked a bit less is the soundtrack. Sometimes, the ST was not representing what was happening on screen. Also, I found it a tad boring, meaning that it looked too simple at times. However, most of it was okay to excellent. I liked how the characters did not take too long to understand what was going on. That was a good example of teamwork! Kimi no na wa has a rich story, great developement and an insane plot twist. It was fun to watch, and if I can give you a suggestion: if you find yourself not understanding what is going on, be patient; everything will come to you in time.

So to be clear, here are the Pros:
-Rich story/developement
-Great character design and behaviour
-Smooth, fancy, well drawn visual art

Cons:
-Soundtrack is lacking coherence at times
-Story might be hard to understand right at the beginning.

Great anime, 9/10 rating. Thanks for reading my review of Kimi no Na wa.",9
78,cordarr,"What. A. Masterpiece.
My mind was blown away by this amazing piece of art produced by Makoto Shinkai. A movie that should be on your watchlist regardless of whether you watch anime or not.

The plot is original, the characters are interesting and relatable, the visuals stunning, and the music from RADWIMPS is a cut above the rest. Your Name is one of those films that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. I was left feeling empty as it ended, as I remembered that I had to come back to reality. Not many movies have made me feel this way. Definitely a must-watch.",10
79,spitfiire,"""Your name"", nostalgic isn't it?
Two powerful words used in the conversation between two people who have just meet, thinking that bond will last forever, yet as years go by and ""your hair eventually turns gray"" we tend to forget who we are and who we were.
Who you loved, who cared about you, who helped you, who...was always there for you when you were younger. We cant go against this law of nature, this flow of time, this forever lasting curse that is called memory. For we humans are the peak of evolution who have a built in instinct to survive,adapt and overcome any obstacle that is in our way including human emotion and memory.
Yet this movie gives you the impression that there is still hope, that there is still that one shinning star in a gloomy sky who illuminates the way in front of us.
I do not write reviews, so bare with me my brothers and sisters for this movie is such a masterpiece that you cannot just write this review with minimal effort.
Note that i will try NOT SPOIL this movie for you in any way, if you think that i have in any way overstepped my boundaries feel free to inform me and i shall remove/edit it asap.
Now without further ado let me begin.

Story: 10/10
The plot is simple and unusual, and yes i have already watched 5 Centimeters Per Second, i mean who hasn't?
So maybe i am giving it a 10/10 for the plot simply because i can somewhat relate to the movie + i am a sucker for romance, overall its just my opinion.

Art: 10/10
Nothing to say here, if you watched the trailer for this movie you already know that these people put in a lot of effort into making it thus it would be unfair to give it anything less than a 10, heck i would rate it even 11 if i could.
The animation is breathtaking and flawless, simply said : Omigoto *claps*

Sound: 9/10
Well if you watched the movie you should have noticed that some scenes are just ""Wow the feels"", what i mean by that is some soundtracks are perfectly selected for some scenes,for example scene 1 and soundtrack 1 are in perfect harmony which equals to perfection, while some are like scene 2 + soundtrack 5 equals to just ""meh"", there is no harmony in that, if you catch my drift?
If you don't understand what i mean ( cant blame you tho, i am a complicated individual) then just watch the whole thing and you will hopefully notice these little details.
But overall i gave it a 9/10 because they almost did it flawlessly, note that this little thing is not going to affect my overall opinion.
But like they say ""You watch it, you rate it. ""


Characters: 6/10
I am always rough on the whole character thing to be honest, but to keep it plain and simple.
I am a sucker for romance, the emotions are there, the voice actors did their part yet why am i giving it only a 6 out of 10?
Cliche friends, cliche.
You can notice all these traits almost in every genre/tag in the Romance section.
The two MC are nothing new in this department, clumsy, likable and did i mention clumsy. If you find this sentence to be a spoiler then my man/girl you probably forgot to do your homework. I know its harsh, i know i am a baka but please do not hate on me for this one people..

Enjoyment: 10/10
Nothing to say except Shinkai Makoto, you the man.
If you watched 5 Centimeters Per Second you know what i am talking about.
This man know his stuff, he knows how to punch and always saves his best punches to finish you off.
Just watch it and you will know what i am talking about.

Overall: 10/10
Really enjoyed this work of art, haven't boarded the feels train in like a week, you know the rest.
Moral of this story is quite simple and quite the hard hitter.
I won't give you the details but know this.
Enjoy your life, never forget the bonds you already have, try to keep and cherish them for as long as possible.
Value your opinion and of course respect yourself and your family.
Keep moving forward without looking back because you never know what the future hold in store for you, maybe just maybe you get one more chance from life to try something with someone you love and cherish.


Keep it real you beautiful people and i hope you have a nice day.",10
80,kaizersaber,"I’ll be honest when I say that I never really wanted to watch Kimi no Na wa. There was always too much hype around it and it wasn’t until about a year later that I finally decided that I should pick it up. In particular, I was feeling bitter and sore about how this anime managed to jump to 1st place on MAL in scores, besting my favorite anime, FMA:B, for several months when it was first released. I thought to myself, “How could there be ANY anime that could even compare to FMA:B?”

In fact, I was appalled by the fact that this wasn’t even a TV series anime - Kimi no Na wa is just a single movie. I had my doubts. Can there really be sufficient character and plot development in a mere 1 hour and 46 minutes of screen time? Can a story which is centered around the cheesiest anime trope - a high school romance - really be any good?

I am glad to say however, that I was pleasantly surprised at how Makoto Shinkai managed to deliver so much, so succinctly, in this anime. The plot is surprisingly delightful - it wasn’t perfect, for sure, but it was interesting enough to keep you sitting through that without feeling one bit bored. The characters were really as rich as they could be for an anime movie and I would gladly welcome spin-offs to grant deeper insight into their backstories. But this anime impressed me the most with its jaw-dropping, stunning visuals and of course an amazing, beautiful musical score to go along with it.

To put it in the voice of the main cast, Kimi no Na Wa was absolutely…",10
81,Sly1206,"This is literal perfection. It is impossible to put in words how amazing this movie is, but I will try my best.
When I watched this show I was very doubtful on how good was. I heard for from and online source that is a great movie and a must see for anime lovers, along with it being #17 in ratings. However after I watched it I was blown away. It made me feel a combinations of different emotions that I can't really describe, it actually gave me a adrenaline rush.
I feel in love with characters and rooted for them throughout the film, the story was compelling to watch play out. The art was absolutely beautiful the best I have ever seen in a movie. The sound and music were great pulling me and immersed myself into the film. I had great great time watching the movie and it is my favorite movie of all time now if you hadn't seen it then your missing out from an experience of a life time",10
82,Anyi_lizethBuwan,"Now, to start off:
At first, this film may not seem all too interesting and it may appear to be just a standard “romance” animation between two characters - I was starting to think that at first, but I don’t mind things like that anyway. However, this film is definitely worth putting in the effort to watch all of it; this is because it transforms into one hell of a film. Personally, I find the thought of swapping bodies with each other both amusing and also quite interesting as well as the silly antics that the two protagonists get up to as soon as they realise that they have swapped bodies; I loved how they interacted with their family and friends and I found it sweet how traditional Mitsuha and her family were.
However, this where the film takes a dark turn which I was so shocked to see but I also loved it at the same time; this is where the film begins to get really good but also really sad at the same time. As I mentioned, the first premise of the film highlights how the two protagonists react when they find out that they occasionally swap bodies whenever they wake up in the morning and then they start to tease each other as well as laugh and have fun; but this is the last bit of their happiness.
When Taki goes to try and visit her for the first time, he finds out the place she lived was no longer - many people thought that was delusional for this, but the “place” that she “lived” was just a massive crater due to the fact that a meteor had hit it three years earlier killing upwards of 500+ inhabitants (almost a third at the time).
This is evidently quite a shock to Taki because he always thought that they were just interacting with each other in real time, but no, he was swapping bodies with a girl who lived 3 years ago. Ergo, Taki then tries his best to try and save her - he tries to do this by by managing to swap bodies with her one last time in an attempt to warn the inhabitants that the meteor is going to split in two and that extra bit that fell off will devastate their local districts. In attempt to do this, he also visits the shrine in which Mitsuha and her sister lay “a part of themselves” for them to come back to this realm after they were gone. Well, this worked because they managed to see each other via the use of “twilight” (also known as “golden hour”); however, as they get closer to saving each other, they begin to forget each other’s names - they know that they must save someone special to them, but they just cannot remember their names (hence the name of the film, “Your Name”). Mitsuha could have gotten their districts saved a while sooner, but her dad refused to listen to her (who is the mayor of their town/village). After failed attempts at getting people to leave, we finally see the meteor crashing down into the village and destroying everything in its path - sad music plays at the time, I honestly thought they had failed (I believe that’s what the producers were wanting us to think).

Honestly, my review does NOT do this film enough justice; no wonder it is the highest grossing animated film in Japan (Japanese anime film, that is) to date. This film’s story is both comical yet absolutely heart-wrenching and it certainly had me in tears at the end of it because I didn’t think they would.",10
83,Narzik246,"The story was very well made and very straight to the point, it did a good job of making you wonder what's happening, but also it lets you know what's happening.

The art style and animation were very smooth and fluent, I would've continued watching even if the story was boring.


Before I watched this the ending was spoiled for me and thought ""I won't be satisfied with this ending"", but I was wrong because after watching the whole thing this ending is pretty suiting/fitting.
I always procrastinated from watching this anime for 2 years and I now wish I watched this the moment it was released.",10
84,zimpp,"This movie is actually something that could change the way you look at some of the things that happen in life. I really enjoyed watching this amazing movie, because it made me look different to what I feel and made me realize that no matter how impossible it looks, you need to keep follow your dreams. I'll try keeping my review spoiler-less as much as I can

I gotta say that I got pretty confused about this switch of Mitsuha and Taki, i couldn't know when Mitsuha is really Mitsuha or Taki in Mitsuha's body, excluding this little problem, the movie was so great and I really recommend it to anyone ^^

Kimi no na wa, a great movie",9
85,Pageplant,"I don't often watch stuff like this, but I watched this one with a person very dear to me. It's a beautiful and romantic movie which doesn't do anything special, but still manages to avoid the biggest and most cringe cliches of the genre while being interesting and touching. It has some beautiful thoughts, scenes and ideas and I can tell that I will remember it with a smile and nostalgia later in life. It isn't a masterpiece in my opinion because it's very fast and we don't have the time to start caring for main characters that much. Still, I recommend it to everyone who loves a beautiful movie.",9
86,rikimaaru,"Probably my first review. I might have written one before, but I'm not a pro at this but I'll do my best to convince you to watch this movie because you share good things that make you feel warm inside to other people so they may feel warm inside.

I was able to watch the World Premiere of this movie at Anime Expo July 3, 2016. I have to say it was truly an amazing movie.

There might be some spoilers-but not intentional-in this so read at your own risk.
I'm rating this a 9 because I tend to suspend my disbelief to the fullest due to my personal bias for Shinkai films. There are unanswered questions and whatnot, but I don't care about that. Just know that it isn't perfect and that there are kinks but for the somewhat realistic review of this movie, I will not be giving it a perfect score across the board as much as I'd love to.


Story:
This movie is probably at the top of my list, if not very close to the top, of my favorite movies. The story was nothing like I personally had ever seen but still had Shinkai's generic boy-meet-girl plot. A city boy and country girl are connected through time because of this comet that comes every 1000 years or so and they end up trying to meet. They one day wake up in each others bodies, without knowing anything about the other and end up exploring and falling in love(?).

Art:
If any regular tv anime was able to produce at this quality, I'd be watching everything just for the art. Shinkai sets a whole new standard in animation and cinematography. I'm a fan of scenery and with Shinkai's creations, it's impossible for me to rate it anything under 10.

As with any Shinkai movie, he adds another depth to his art. His well-crafted CG animations are so high-quality and well thought out so that everything just looks as breathtaking as possible. It's almost as if he has broken through the dimension of animation and entered reality-just an exaggeration but you get the point. Even if you have your eyes fixated on the focal point of each screen you can't help but notice the details he puts in the background. I was able to purchase Shinkai's art book regarding '5cm per second' at AX also, and it truly was one purchase i won't regret. Each scene is just so wonderfully crafted to capture the emotions and keep it flowing through the scenes to come.

Sound:
Shinkai employs one of his favorite bands-RADWIMPS-to create a soundtrack for him. They had the script I believe about a year and a half ( not really sure) beforehand to be able to create the compliment to his masterpiece. The soundtrack was wonderful. I had no complaints about anything other than the fact that I have to wait for it to come out. RADWIMPS definitely delivered a high-quality score that is able to capture the feelings of the moments and put it out. The score also was able to flow with the direction of the plot and characters that it felt so natural for a song to come out.

The voice acting in this was also amazing. The actors did a wonderful job, especially the voice of Mitsuha, Mone Kamishiraishi. Her voice was beautiful and I definitely felt the emotions behind her voice in particular scenes which I grew more attached to after finding out that she's still new to voice acting. The male lead's voice actor Ryunosuke Kamiki is more experience and therefore was also able to fulfill the role fully. Their voices were wonderful and fit the characters to which they were assigned.

Character: ( I suck at this so you can skip this part. then again I'm a noob when it comes to writing reviews.)

Given that this is a movie, their developments early on aren't too complex. It becomes established they are simple teenagers in their respective niches in the population, but somehow as the story progresses we are given more and more complexity to their character but not the depth you'd see in a television series. The story definitely played a big role in developing them. The side characters just are there, the typical discovery-help protagonist-gone type of deal. Not too much on the side characters, a few moments here and there which helps the side characters feel like a natural part of the characterization of the two leads.

Enjoyment:
I have to say I was not bored a single moment of this movie. Maybe it's because I'm such a fan for Makoto Shinkai films or that I was able to attend the world premiere at my first Anime Expo, but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I was interested in the movie and there were some cringe worthy moments but not without a few gags here and there. It was a well-crafted movie to keep you entertained but isn't enough you make you watch this over and over and over again. It's one of those gems you watch again every blue moon. You watch it when it's nearly faded in your memory so that you may experience a wonderful movie once more. It's also a romance genre film, and I'm a fan for romance so this also allowed me to stay interested.

Overall:
If you like HD pictures, scenery, romance, science and anime, this movie is worth watching. Some may not agree with the ratings and that's totally fine- to each his own.

But as for my 2cents, this is a well crafted movie filled with stunning graphics and scenes driven by a romance plot centered around two teenagers from different worlds connected by some cosmic event filled with a wonderful soundtrack.

I would recommend this to you if you like any of the aforementioned categories above. I've already been bugging my friends to go watch this as soon as it becomes available.",9
87,LazyPanther,"I went into watching this movie expecting a masterpiece but I was left kind of underwhelmed at the end. My review will focus more on the flaws of this movie because this movie has been praised many different ways and nothing can be said that hasn't been said before.

Don't get me wrong this movie was really enjoyable. Animation, visuals and soundtrack are amazing and top notch.
Story was good as well.

But there are some issues with the execution of the story. In the beginning there is a problem with story-telling like some events critical to the plot occurring off-screen then being told about in third person the next day. Its always better to show, not tell. Because of this for the first 30-40 minutes, at times, there were some pacing issues where the plot seemed to drag. The plot seemed unfocused at times where important plot points are put aside in favor of side stories. This kind of story-telling would have been fine if it were a 12-episode anime but for a 106 min movie every second counts especially when you are dealing with 2 stories that could have been 2 separate movies.

The main characters' relationship was somewhat under-developed. First there is some body swapping with accompanying comedy and then there is some hint of mutual appreciation and care. Then a montage happens and then we are literally told ""they like each other, so root for them"". For a movie that relies heavily on romance to drive its plot there needed to be some significant development of romance early on. So it could act as an effective catalyst for the last half of film.

There were also some major tonal shifts at times from standard rom-com to straight up tragedy but this was somewhat necessary to keep the movie enjoyable without being too heavy handed.


Before watching it I was kind of pissed about this movie not being nominated for an Oscar. But after watching it I get why it didn't get nominated.

Overall this movie is really good and enjoyable but don't expect it to be a masterpiece.",8
88,tehnoobcakez,"Kimi no Na wa is an aesthetically stunning and musically breathtaking masterpiece by director Makoto Shinkai which builds upon his previous works to deliver a film which is both fulfilling and thoroughly enjoyable. Watch it if you have not done so already.

What Kimi no Na wa presents to the audience is the maturation of director Makoto Shinkai's work. Those familiar with Shinkai's previous works (for example Byousoku 5 Centimeter and Kotonoha no Niwa) should be accustomed to his tendencies of creating bittersweet and unresolved endings; love him or loathe him, Shinkai's latest work demonstrates a slight deviation from this usual style. While the finale of the film remains relatively open-ended, there are many more reasons to be optimistic for what comes after than compared to his previous works.
",10
89,Zelev,"Let me start off by saying this is a movie that is heavily ""supernatural"" driven. While other shows may contain supernatural elements, they fail to lay out the foundation of those very elements until it is convenient; in other words, they usually wait to explain until the very end. However, with Your Name, it was laid out from the very beginning. By doing so, it marks a consistency and gives itself time to explore its world while not leaving you in the dark about the paranormal that is at play. This was one of the movie's essential strong points.

From the starting point, a comet was able to be seen by people from many places - two in particular. While the heavily populated city life brings up this sense of individuality and independence, the more community-based counterpart has a motif of connectivity and unity. Understandably, the contrasts of living in an exciting city or serene countryside - reinforced by the undeniably attractive visuals - is enticing to any eye. One could argue that anime, a form of art, is intended to make you feel, or make you think, or simply to be enjoyed. Although, one should also ask themselves what the perspective really is when viewing someone's story. Every good story should have a purpose, and every purpose should be supported by its story. Makoto Shinkai's works are similar in the sense that they are on an emotional spectrum with a sensitive side rather than a philosophical one more grounded to reality. You could debate about whether an anime is ""realistic"" or not, but then you would lose sight of the point. Kimi no Na wa ends up fabricating an interesting spin on the theory of time travel by implementing a supernatural twist of body switching along with it. However, by creating a reason that triggers these two elements, it manages to combine them both.

The body switching aspect playfully reveals the lives of our two main characters, the adventurous Mitsuha Miyamizu and the diligent Taki Tachibana. Mitsuha lives a more traditional and spiritual life while Taki lives a more modern and covetous lifestyle. While being in each other's bodies, they learn the little details about each other and grow to understand or respect one another's viewpoint. They, quite noticeably, influence and grow as individuals despite the unconventional role of communication or interaction. The prevalent theme of being connected is both shown from a direct and indirect position; from a straightforward supernatural approach to a much more broader concept of the ""universe"" in an intangible, spiritual sense. This theme is particularly supported by the comet itself that is present from start to finish. While the themes were certainly consistent, Kimi no Na wa's message is made evident by the ""divide"" in time and polarity of differences.

Overall, Your Name has an unyielding story right down to the title. Although it may not be on the realistic side, it is certainly an interesting and engaging experience that manages to deliver its overarching message of looking at the bigger picture.",8
90,Project_Pems,"Easily the weakest part of an amazing movie. Suspension of disbelief is mandatory:

>Some characters could actually be removed and the story wouldn't change very much (Like, say, Tsutomu, Okudera, and Mitsuha's father). Taki and Mitsuha as characters were never developed enough to require so many characters anyway.

>The concept of body swapping is never explained, and the rice wine scene not only complicates things, but also feels even more contrived. And we haven't gotten to the scene where they meet up. So much time wasted trying to figure that out.

>How did they not check the date differences while in each other's bodies? It was very clear they still remembered who they really were, even if they didn't remember spending time in each other's bodies. The part where the messages delete themselves is even more ridiculous, and why does Taki keep a cord that a stranger throws out for him?

>There's one part where Taki doesn't write his name in Mitsuha's hand, letting her forget him and nearly walk away from him at the ending. Honestly felt like a forced attempt at making the audience question if Shinkai was going to pull another 5 Centimeters. Wouldn't have worked perfectly either way (Still would've enjoyed it though).

Art: 9.5

Not much to say, other than praise. Absolutely amazing art. The comet and the lake were honestly some of the most surreal and incredible things I've seen in anime. The only gripe I have is the character designs.

It's difficult to describe how I feel, but to put it briefly, the characters do not feel endemic to the movie. If one were to take the characters and place them in a forgettable slice of life romcom, they wouldn't really be that out of place.

Sound: 8

Music in this movie is not that memorable. However, some parts where the music played was absolutely spot on. The use of rock music doesn't take away from the movie at all. The voice acting was also spot on. Mitsuha's voice is strangely pleasant to listen to, and I hope she does more anime roles in the future.

Characters: 7

Many characters that were in the film itself were almost completely unnecessary. Taki and Mitsuha's lives are glossed over, and the film had characters that led almost nowhere. Mitsuha is shown having problems with her father, but they never get resolved. Okudera and Tsutomu could've been removed from the movie and barely anything would've changed.

Enjoyment: 10

And yet, despite all it's flaws, I greatly enjoyed it. I would still recommend this to people who are bored and looking for something to keep them for a while. Still, I can't help but feel as though this movie should've been an anime series. If they had put more emphasis on Taki and Mitsuha's backgrounds and took the time to explain the body swapping, this could've been a masterpiece.",8
91,macklez,"I would give this movie a 9.3 overall if I could put decimals. My enjoyment on the 10 scale is at, like, 12. I highly recommend that anyone should watch this but especially if you are into more atmospheric movies. There aren't many other movies like Kimi no Na wa that will build an atmosphere and then drive it through (that I know of) the way it was executed. I even recommend listening to the entire OST before watching. Then watch the movie, and listen again. Overall, Kimi no Na wa is definitely one of my favourite anime movies out there and I highly recommend to watch it.",9
92,CCshinobi,"Kimi no Nawa is up there with the quality of work Studio Ghibli makes. It’s a journey in a world breathing with atmosphere, mystery, and visual wonder. A journey about growth and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. A journey about human emotion that transcends space and time, as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate. A journey that might just be one of the most captivating anime movie experiences I've had in years.

Director Makoto Shinkai’s artistry is something people tend to love or hate, but this film is solid proof to all of his disdainful critics that his movies were never “just eye candy”. They explore the nature of life and relationships in quiet ways rarely seen or discussed, which is why most of them are not fast-paced or action packed...and why they are so beautiful. But even if you’re not a fan of this kind of style with its major use of metaphorical imagery and mixture of subtle and explosive emotions, definitely give Kimi no Nawa a chance. This is by far his most ambitious, original movie in many ways. For instance, there’s an actual mystical element to the story apart from his previous films that are set purely on realism. The pacing is a lot faster and intense. There’s a surprising amount of humor in the script, making the chemistry between the characters more light-hearted and comically entertaining than expected. All of this is done through a narrative vision so emotional, so brilliantly realized, that I’m pretty sure everyone at the Anime Expo world premiere screening was tearing up, including me.

Without spoiling, what mainly drives this film's story is the dynamics of our main characters’ relationship. The way these two interact is just so unique and lovable. The premise itself allows them to bond on a more personal level, far more intriguing than the usual teenage love story where boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy gets girl. Eventually, you become so invested in their strange relationship, that when all the action goes down, it's no longer just suspenseful - it's almost heartbreaking.

Editing and sound design play a HUGE role in this immersion. There’s rarely a single dull moment because of how gripping and emotionally driven the timing of every cut is. The sound design combined with a beautiful music score is outstanding - subtle and moving when creating atmosphere, powerful at times of dramatic conflict. In fact, the same can be said for pretty much all of the visual aesthetics - which if I haven't already mentioned, are amazing. This is a prime example of astonishingly jaw-dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling.
Kimi no Nawa is not just any anime movie. It has the potential to be viewed and studied as art cinema. It’s so beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed, I feel like I didn’t even cover 80% of its greatness in this review. To do that, I would have to make a spoiler analysis review, and to do that, I would probably have to see the movie again, maybe a couple more times before I can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece.

I know I sound like I’m fanboying, but I’m being fully honest here - if Director Makoto Shinkai keeps this kind of quality up, he is going to be an even bigger name in the anime industry for years to come. Remember Your Name long enough until it's available in your country, if you're not seeing it in Japan theaters. Because trust me, you're not going to forget it.",10
93,Naneo,"This is the first anime movie i've ever watched and it bring a great expectation to me. When someone mention anime movie this is the first thing that crossed my mind, the movie is just so iconic. Thanks to this now i can dive into anime movie, at first i'm scared that this won't meet my expectation because movie is shorter than anime and it will lack of story or character. But no, it is higher than my expectation and now i can safely say that anime movie is also great.

If you haven't watch this movie yet, go watch it. I can't guarantee that you will like it or anything, but you will get a good experience with it. Even my brother that isn't into anime really like this movie when i encourage him to watch it. This movie is a masterpiece and no one can change my mind.

Thank you for reading my review.",10
94,Goldsofa,"When I was in middle school and high school, I was the boy that sat in the back corner of the classroom and observed everyone. I liked and hated everyone almost equally. Sure, I had a few crushes, but I didn't talk much and just dismissed them as a fantasy. A waste of my time. So when I watched 5 Centimeters per Second, it pissed me off. I hated the characters. I hated the story. I hated the lack of fluidity. When I read that the director, for what I then thought was a piece of trash, was named Makato Shinkai, I made it a point to never watch anything by him.

Then I saw Garden of Words.

As much as I hated 5 Centimeters per Second, I still acknowledged the insane attention to detail in the animation. Garden of Words was no exception, but the story completely caught me off guard. I wondered if such a work was by the same director. It was only later that I understood, and appreciated, the intention to the emotional ambiguity that is so prevalent in his early works. For those of you who watched Garden of Words, you will know that there is an emotional stance that is made. I think that was the scene where Makato Shinkai truly found his rhythm.

Kimi no na Wa (Your Name) is a story that shouldn’t be relatable. Yet, it resounds deeply in all of us. It shouldn't make sense, yet the scene placements couldn't have been clearer. The characters should be despised, yet I find myself fascinated by them. When I finished watching, I just sat there dumbfounded. Needless to say, it was beautiful. Not a lot of movies or anime do that to me. In fact, the feelings I had were very similar to what I felt when I watched Spirited Away for the first time 10 years ago.

Makato Shinkai was very deliberate in what scene he placed where in the story. Every dialogue, every frame, every detail has a meaning. There was not a single second that can be deleted from this movie without losing the meaning. EVERYTHING is calculated flawlessly. This reminds me of the scene in Bakuman when Shujin and Saiko decide to switch gears and do mainstream manga instead of cult manga. Mattorai said something very interesting, mangakas can make manga in two ways: at random - coming straight from the pen to paper in order to keep everything fresh and unpredictable, or calculated to such a high degree that every plot line seems to be unpredictable when it really isn't. As you can imagine, being calculated is unprecedentedly difficult, leaving a majority of the famous mangakas to write randomly without too much thought. If such is truly the case, then there is no way that Kimi no na Wa could be written without thinking it through and through - which leads to question how much of a genius Makato Shinkai truly is.

It's been roughly 500 words and I haven't analyzed a single element of the movie yet, and in truth, I don't think I will. This movie is rare… unimaginably rare. Nothing like it will ever exist. I don't see any justice in reviewing something like that so early. There shouldn't be a debate on whether you should watch this movie or not. History will undoubtedly look at this as a classic.

It's pretty apparent that I gave this review, if you can call it that, to much of a biased praise. I can write an analysis on the symbolism, the plot structure, the character duality, and so on and so forth, but I don't see the point in it. Giving such a winded explanation isn't proper at this time. 20 years from now, when people criticize future anime, they will most definitely quote scenes from this movie. An analysis to this movie will come, and without a second thought by some. But, I think that, for now, watching and appreciating is the best we can do.",10
95,Tozzy,"Taking ‘put yourself in someone else’s shoes’ to a whole new level, the latest film from director Makoto Shinkai (5cm per Second, Garden of Words) is a heartfelt exploration of empathy, love and loss. Kimi no Na wa (otherwise known as “Your Name”) revolves around two characters, Mitsuha and Taki, who are caught up in a strange phenomenon that allows them to see into each other’s lives. Mitsuha lives out in the countryside while Taki is a Tokyo resident, which means the pair have a window into places they’ve never seen or experienced before. The strange moments they both go through naturally lead to conflicts but eventually their situation evolves into something much more profound. It’s funny, sad, horrifying, uplifting and mesmerising all in equal doses. Kimi no Na wa will reward you the more blind you go into the film. It’s a fairly simple story, filled with common themes, but elevated into something very memorable.

Shinkai has progressed beyond simply exploring concepts of love to actually writing interesting characters to express those ideas. By creating lead characters who have personalities that are actually integral to the story (Mitsuha especially so) Shinkai has managed to make something truly engaging, something that rewards you as a viewer. As a director he’s searched for ways to explore the boundaries around love but with Kimi no Na wa he’s infused enough life into the cast to make every emotional punch really hit home. There’s enough meaningful time dedicated to building thriving landscapes around both Mitsuha and Taki that Shinkai’s film doesn’t just look pretty, it is filled with wonder. Because of this he has delivered characters who manage to be equally captivating as the jaw dropping scenery they’re within – something I’m not accustomed to seeing from his films.

The story of Kimi no Na wa certainly has its predictable moments but I’m happy to overlook them because the narrative is executed so well. There’s enough new complications added to the tale as it progresses to keep it interesting and there’s sufficient foreshadowing to make reveals incredibly satisfying. Shinkai manages to make full use of both Taki and Mitsuha’s social circles to develop their characters and make their plight something worth our time. That’s something many anime TV series struggle to do, even with plenty more runtime up their sleeve to work with.

One of the most insufferable things watching any high school anime drama is how painfully overwrought things can get when it comes to characters expressing their feelings. While Kimi no Na wa comes close at times to overstepping the mark thankfully it manages to maintain a level of sensibility. The comedy and drama is balanced refreshingly well. There’s enough light hearted moments injected in patches throughout the movie to prevent it from becoming an over-emotional burden to sit through. It would be wrong to go so far as to call the handling of the drama ‘realistic’, but it’s wonderful to sit through something that doesn’t require the characters to inundate us constantly with how they’re feeling. Shinkai’s art, character actions and expressions all do that for us.

Speaking of that art, you know it’s going to be good. You don’t need me to tell you that. There’s endless details to be found in the background art and the animation is fluid. The score is gorgeous and it feels like no expense was spared in the sound design. Now that Shinkai has crafted some memorable characters to be a part of all this lush and vivid scenery these art and sound assets don’t feel wasted. For once I feel like I’m watching one of his films where the characters and art have been treated with equal importance, instead of being unbalanced in favour of the latter.

I was initially hesitant to the idea of people calling Makoto Shinkai the next Miyazaki but if he manages to continually craft wondrous adventures like Kimi no Na wa then I can get behind the notion. However, this will be hard to top. Some would, understandably, find Kimi no Na wa a little emotionally cumbersome and easy to predict where it may be going story-wise, but the film just clicked for me. Shinkai’s spin on young love is oozing with artistic flair and packed with stirring set pieces. It is an immensely satisfying watch from start to finish.",9
96,bigctai,"Honestly, if I were to rate Your Name based on story alone, it probably would not receive the same score. It is not a mind-blowing plot, nor is it terribly intricate, nor is it wholly coherent. There are holes in the story here and there as well as some developments that are hard to believe. But all that comes second to the most important factor: how the movie makes you feel.

Watching this film is liberating. It is a beautiful story elevated through even more captivating art that provides a level of emotional stimulus simply impossible to find in a live action Hollywood movie. It is so full of raw emotion that plot becomes secondary to a single burning hope that, while timid in the beginning, erupts into an all-consuming desire.

Part of that emotion stems from the movie's authenticity and its delivery. Your Name is a depiction of adolescent freedom and agency that is raw and personal. Characters aren't drawn as archetypes or following any tropes, but as actual people who are relatable and enjoyable to watch. In addition, their reactions to the supernatural phenomena around them and their interactions with each other are all depicted in a very realistic manner. The story follows its own lively and engaging rhythm, in which well-timed comedy is juxtaposed with excruciatingly timed drama. And even more impressively, the story touches upon its themes without getting lost in them; modern meets traditional, youth meets adult, rural meets urban, all wrapped into a film about a meteor and body swap. And not a single moment feels ill-paced.

This is complemented by visceral artwork that forces one to feel his/her way through the movie in awe and a soundtrack that heightens the emotional atmosphere that the art conjures. Throughout the first and second act of the film, the movie's stunning visual and auditory components make the story that much more engaging. But come the third act is where they truly go to the next level. The shots are jaw-dropping and the music is heart-wrenching, and they both work in flawless conjunction with the story, pulling the audience along into an unforgettable and cathartic end.",10
97,likraken,"I found this to ve a very emotional film and would recommend watching it. It does not waste time in trivial things (although I wonder why Mitsuha cuts her hair? And also, I don't think it was clear why Mitsuha and Taki were specifically chosen for each other...fate?). The ending is satisfying and the movie manages to keep you engaged all the way through.",9
98,BlueKite,"Kimi no Na wa is Makoto Shinkai's latest work that has been well-received so far to the point of being over-hyped. While I don't see this as a masterpiece, it has a lot of strong points and at the same time has weak points as well. First off, the premise is not that original yet it still tries to grab the viewer's interest. I like how the body-switching gimmick is handled with a sense of realism in it. For example, an individual's natural curiosity towards the opposite sex and also how the voice actors of the protagonists handle the role of a person trapped inside a body of an opposite sex very well. As the story progress the two protagonists know that they must set ways to deal with the problematic situation such as leaving notes before they switch back to normal which I find quite creative. Accompanied with the Shinkai standard visuals and soundtrack, the overall atmosphere of the movie is lighthearted.

On the weaker side of things, the movie takes a blow by the introduction of time-travel elements in the second half of the story. The lighthearted atmosphere gradually grow intensely into an emotional rollercoaster. I like plots that tend to be intense and emotional but the way the movie transitions the atmosphere is kinda off-putting. As the movie absorbs you into its change of atmosphere, there is a noticeable inconsistency in pacing. It's probably because the time-travel makes it sort of convoluting. The flow of time and memory begins to distort. There are plot points that, while emotionally packed, are hard to take seriously. It takes a while for the suspension of disbelief to sink in at the idea of switching not only with bodies but also with timelines.

Now why the score of 8 out of 10 when I've been addressing quite the heavy complaint? While the second half starts to crumble the strong start the movie has, I still enjoy and love the movie overall. The ending is satisfactory that, despite having traces of forcefulness to it, is a good change of storytelling in comparison to his previous works such as 5 Centimeters Per Second where there is no definite resolution like a happy ending. I do think that the movie deserves credit for trying to do more with its story despite being partly a failure and a success. Unlike Shinkai's previous films that tend to be overwhelmingly melancholic and distant, Kimi no Na wa assimilates the feeling of a passionate youth which I really like and find beautiful. I like the contrast of the two settings albeit I hoped for a better world-building. I kind of blame myself for having a soft spot for these kinds of coming-of-age stories. The production is great from the gorgeous visuals to the heartwarming soundtrack. I believe that Shinkai can still put out better projects given that his story writing ability has more consistency and substance to it. Whatever the consensus is, this movie will definitely leave an impact to the curious viewer.",8
99,coausti,"I give this movie a 9.16. Almost everything about this movie was expertly done. From the art to the character development there are very little issues to be found. Again, the biggest issue i feel this movie suffers from is the over-hype surrounding it. The only other issue is the forced romance feeling this movie gives off. While the movie is well paced, despite its drawn-out atmospheric scenes, the movie still feels that it speeds by any chance to show any actual feelings beginning to grow between the main characters. Quickly jumping from ""I just met you"" to ""I love you"" gives the only unrealistic feeling in this whole film.

All of that said, I highly suggest you watch this great film.",9
100,mcxydust,"This is basically not a coherent and total lengthy review and I just wanna tell that I rewatched this today (October 4, 2021). This is a total masterpiece on its own actually, in fact, this is the reason why I started watching animes.
Makoto Shinkai works are always stunning, this is the best of his creation so far. I guess that there are already useful reviews out there and I'm running out of words to describe how perfect the movie is (MAL does not approve short reviews anyways).
Story-line => 5/5 (The storyline is the reason why this is considered as a masterpiece); Acting => 5/5 (The voice acting is top-notch. Everything matched the situations.); Directing => 5/5 (I believe in Makoto Shinkai supremacy); Animation => 5/5 (No question about this part.); Screenplay => 5/5 ; Personal Recommendation => 5/5",10

The story wasn't well made. I mean, all the time they were switching (yes, the story is about that they switch their bodies every day when they wake up and forget the day before) and it was really hard to keep an eye on who is who and where. So half of the film I was confused and thinking about that, where are they and who is who.

Second. The characters are great, but I didn't fall in the story, it didn't make me convinced they are in love. All the time they are changing their bodies, but how did they fell in love with this?

Third. An ending is just... Nah. It is as you think from the first minute or the reading any review of this anime. I didn't like it, as it doesn't make any sense and it's quite boring and usual expectable ending.

6/10 I guess.",6
102,EvaFotia,"An anime loved and hated by many. For me, it was an in-between, i loved the whole plot reveal with the future and the past thing but i felt like the Twilight place and the multiple plot holes confuses the viewer. It kind of falls under a Neon Genesis Evangelion situation where the movie expects us to understand the whole concept of time, the mitsubu, the strings and all that super easily but it just gets super convoluted at the final half of the movie.

Character development kinda sucks in this movie lol. The whole movie builds up Mitsuha's Dad as a massive dickhead to Mitsuha and her family yet at the final moments, he is convinced by Mitsuha to evacuate the whole city? There's legit ZERO Explanation behind how she convinced her Dad nor how the whole city evacuated right before the meteor struck other than LOL COINCIDENCE.

Besides stunning visuals and soundtrack, the plot fails to come to a understandable conclusion and while many have theorized and filled the plot holes, it is up for the movie to do that, not the viewer.",7
103,SuperDorio," I don't like this movie.

Kimi no na wa is outstanding in terms of animation, but that's my problem, because for this movie is more important animating as outstanding as possible so people go ''wow, that looks very realistic'' every 5 minutes... but it doesn't add more than that in terms of creativity.

This movie could have been a live action movie, and it would be mediocre at it's best, like, literally you could have the same script, the same music, all of it is very poor, literally the only thing that saves this movie (kinda) is it's animation, and JUST BECAUSE they did it very realistic... like, why, what was the point? there's no reason for this to be an animated movie because it does not matter, the animation doesn't add anything important to the movie, like exaggerated faces or different colors so that we could feel more, it doesn't have that spark, this movie is just empty.",6

Firstly, the story, i like it, the effect of two chars able to switch their body, i enjoy it. Unfortunately, i prefered that in the first part, I hoped for it to be longer, even if i had some difficulties to know if they were really them or not. For the second part, wasn't really what i liked because this is not what i wanted to see in this movie, i'm not a big fan of Journey and science fiction elements

For the artstule, I see that they'""re made to be for a movie which is nice, but I didn't really like the character design, while we talk about the chars, the past of the girl is interesting, the hero's one no

For the sound, i agree that the musics are linked to the anime but unfortunately, i didn't like them

I will not only denigrate the movie because i still had a good time while watching it, i understand that some people can find it perfect but for me it will just be a good movie.",7
106,saggz,"I don't understand how this movie got so high up the ratings. I watched 
it because it looked popular and had a very high rating but I couldn't

them because I felt like shutting it off there and just not watching the
 rest. 



If you're only going to watch this because of it's popularity, DON'T! 
I'm starting to think it was a website malfunction that put this at the 
top of the list because it sure doesn't compare to some of the other 
stuff that is lower down the rating.



POOR!

          
        Awful story, hard to keep linear, it's all over the place. Sci-Fi meets some sick, twisted teenage girl love show.



*****TL;DR - This movie is absolute garbage.

107,ecassan,"How is this the best-rated feature-length anime on here? Honestly, I 
can't figure this out. I kind of feel cheated by this near-unanimous 
praise, as I personally couldn't enjoy or relate to this story nearly as
 much as everyone else did, apparently.



[NO OBVIOUS SPOILERS BELOW, JUST A RATHER VAGUELY-WORDED PERSONAL OPINION. GOING TO KEEP IT SHORT, ANYWAY]



The plot is predictable almost every step of the way, a weak and quite 
transparent attempt to ""pull at your heartstrings"". The best word to 
describe the characters is... bland. Virtually nothing in the story 
makes the viewer actually care about them on any deeper level beyond the
 very

          
        surface. Basically an ""okay, might as well see this thing 
through to the end"" type of situation. No real investment, no real 
emotional impact. 



I have no serious qualms about the animation itself; on the visual side,
 this was okay. I guess. Nothing spectacular about it though. From the 
get-go, this wasn't the type of anime to aspire to create a particularly
 creative visual style, however, so that's fair. Sound-wise, it's also 
nothing mindblowing... rather boring, actually.



To fans of this anime (and we know there's fans galore), it might seem 
like I'm reaching to just find stuff to criticize, but I seriously, 
honestly did not enjoy this much at all. I'm baffled at how well-loved 
this is, and I'm... sorry? I really was prepared to like this -- I 
didn't.
        ",3
108,DeepDoge,"(I really tried to explain how that ""thing"" feels like.)



I really don't like to see those overrated animes. I don't why but, 
animes getting better until the score 8. But after the score 8, it goes 
worse.

I don't usually give low scores to animes. But this one is not an anime. So there is no problem.



Story

Let be honest there is nothing special about the story.

I can't even find the sentences to describe how basic it is.

Also, there are many questions about how those things are happening. The
 mystery... But I don't really care about those things. Because I 
generally watch animes for the characters I

          
        don't really care about the story part but it was an average.



Story/Characters

This was the kind of story I really don't like. ""The puppets of the 
writer"". While watching the ""anime"", I really didn't understand why they
 are doing those things, why they are acting like that... I know, they 
love each-other but this is the worst part. Why they love each other... 
Because the writer wants it.



Characters

Most of the characters are the personalities I don't like. But it 
doesn't matter because they don't really have personalities. They are 
just puppets. It was like watching some characters that controlling by a
 child. None of them have feelings. I didn't feel anything while 
watching them. I couldn't make any connection with myself. They were 
empty.



Art/Sound

I don't give my art scores for how beautiful they are.



Art

As I said before this is not an anime. This is just a basic love story 
that has mysteries and drawn in anime(ish) style. The art is really nice
 to watch but that's all. If this was just an art competition, I would 
give it a 10. But the art of ""anime"" was absolutely bad. It doesn't even
 deserve a score.

The art in anime should make you feel the feelings of the characters. 
This is what makes it special. But It was just like watching people on 
the street. In real life, you can't know how people feel, but you should
 be able to see the feelings in an anime. You can see the feelings by 
using of many styles in an anime. Even with just using of the facial 
expressions. You may don't look like that in real life. But an anime 
doesn't care about how its look like in real life, it cares how it 
feels. But this was just like watching a movie with anime(ish) draw 
style. So It doesn't even deserve a score.



Sound

The sound was a little bit better but not enough. It was just like the Art.



Enjoyment

I didn't feel anything. I didn't even cry. I couldn't connect to any of 
characters. It was basic. I really don't understand why the people like 
this. But watching the ceiling is much better than watching this anime.



What is this?



Supernatural, mystery?

No, this is a love story.



Love story?

I didn't feel anything.



Feeling of the characters?

What characters? I didn't see anything alive.



I really should give this 1 but people worked really hard on it. So I'm going to give it 2.



Honestly, I couldn't even watch the ""Anime"". Because it keeps saying

""Watch me, give me 10. See that thing, it was beautiful right?!?! I am a
 masterpiece. You should give me 10. Give me 10. I'm a love story. I 
used everything to make me looks like a masterpiece. I'm not good but it
 doesn't matter because I'm the describe of a masterpiece."" 
        ",2
109,Azaraki,"I still can't understand why so many people think this was a 
masterpiece. It had the most lackluster plot with sporadic time loop 
elements that really didn't make any sense. 



The soundtrack was decent at best, and it had a homely and slice of life
 feel to it. Kind of reminds me of those school anime themes.

 The characters really had no development, and absolutely very little depth.



I really had a difficult time trying to enjoy this film due to the 
switching bodies and unusual story that involved way too much random 
things happening. 



I feel like the only reason why people liked this anime

          
        so much was because of the pretty artwork, which really didn't 
do much to help the overall quality of the anime. I can't even begin to 
fathom the fact that it surpassed Spirited away as the highest grossing 
anime film in the internationally.



Overall, i think it pretty much sums up Makoto shinkai and his works. Everyday school life and falling in love. ",3
110,CodeBlazeFate,"*You’ve probably already seen this movie but regardless, mild spoilers 
for the premise that truly reveals itself whole past the synopsis and 
maybe a few specific spoilers along the way*



When most people think of Kimi no Na wa, they think of a simple 
emotionally gripping, beautifully animated masterpiece that touched them
 at their very core. When I think of Kimi no Na wa, I think of a 
tedious, convoluted, contrived, and ultimately misguided emotion-based 
time travel story blessed with wonderful visuals and cursed by its 
confusingly bad time travel narrative and equally hard to stomach main 
leads.



I know, I’m a buzzkill. 



So, why my cynicism?

          
        Before you try to answer, let me take two of them out for you. 
It has little to do with it being in the top 10 on every anime 
aggregation website, or the fact that this not only outsold every single
 Ghibli movie such as the insanely popular Spirited Away, or that it is 
the highest grossing anime movie of all time as of writing. I don't feel
 it was anywhere near good enough to warrant any of that, but it would 
be incredibly petty of me to call that a reason I dislike the film. With
 that out of the way, let's begin with the writing.



A boy and a girl suddenly wake up from a dream, only to realize that 
their bodies have switched. I must say, right out the bat, I like the 
fact that each new day is told from the perspective of one of the two 
characters while switching perspectives to suit a new day in the 
beginning and that it starts on a character being explained to how she 
was acting weird, and putting two and two together allows us to see that
 this is the aftermath of one of these body-switching incidents that 
occur a lot throughout this movie. This is where the compliments of the 
story end for a while.



How long have these two been switching bodies? Given the montage 
especially, it's insanely hard to keep track, and I know it's all thanks
 to a comet, but I doubt a comet would remain visible for a small 
country like Japan for so long that the montage sort of hints at weeks 
of this happening? How come these characters start off thinking they're 
in a dream, even after feeling pain (especially given the whole gag 
cliche based around this exact trope of waking up after pain in a dream)
 and seeing the entire day go by in real-time? I know full well that no 
dream lasts that long without entering at least one period of long, 
non-R.E.M. sleep (and R.E.M. lasts for about 15 minutes and that's when 
you dream, and dreams are never this coherent)? How come after so long, 
nobody tries to put two and two together about this whole thing with 
their own theories until the second half? Speaking of the second half…



The second half is where this movie turns from just irritating to 
convoluted and contrived. A comet from 3 years ago is seen 3 years later
 (I can't fathom how that's supposed to work, especially in such a short
 amount of time given a comet or a star) by these two main characters 
and that's what caused them to switched bodies with each other every 
day, and only them for no adequately explained reason, and that's a 
missed opportunity. We could've had scenes of some other people acting 
weird because of that too, though they would still need to explain it 
well beyond time travel-esque bullshit that doesn't explain anything. It
 turns out that two people end up, for no good reason, figuring it out: 
the grandmother of the girl, and the girl’s father. An explosion happens
 at one point in a major facility and no one considered that a  
dangerous threat after being told that more of this can happen (though 
it's a diversion to evacuate the people from 3 years ago because 
apparently the comet splits and destroys the city that the girl was in, 
including her, meaning it would make no sense how she could connect with
 him, especially since the ending sort of rewrites that, which sort of 
changes the future but people can't do a good time travel plot for 
shit). The ending also just ends with the two sort of recognizing each 
other and then rolling to credits after panning up towards the clouds, 
so...that's something, I guess.



I had to go back and research literally every character’s name, they 
were that forgettable. It's not even like Rogue One where they either 
say most characters’ names once or not at all, they say these guys’ 
names constantly. This has never happened to me before for any anime. 
Let that sink in...and then realize how funny it is that the movie is 
translated as “Your Name” given these circumstances.



Taki and Mitsuha are dense, extremely dense. I mean, I’m a bit of a 
dense person myself as anyone who knows me IRL for longer than a small 
bit will tell you, but these two are infuriatingly dense to the point of
 actual stupidity. There was the “dream” example from earlier but also, 
these guys constantly set rules for each other to not interfere much 
with their lives, only to constantly break them. They conveniently 
forget things for the sake of the plot, though to be fair, that's just 
the plot actively forcing them to forget things for no reason and not 
then being idiots, so back to that. When Mitsuha meets Taki in the 
emotional climax of the film, she straight up calls him an idiot over 
the fact that he often played with her tits when he woke up in her 
body...and this is the first thing g she says to him in the middle of an
 emotional climax. Not “I finally found you” or something befitting of 
such a scene where they first sorta meet each other truly within the 
little time they have before convenient BS makes it so they physically 
don't see each other anymore and proceed to go on their way to 
accomplish a necessary task, but “Baka”. Fucking really?



It's insanely hard to talk about any of the characters’ personalities 
since while outside of the protagonists, none of these are truly bad 
characters, they are insanely forgettable. I forgot everything about 
these people by the time I finished the movie, aside from the fact that 
Mitsuha's little sister doesn't like taking shit from people, and that 
she conveniently forgets something too (not even for plot convenience 
this time, just her being an idiot at one point in the final act). I 
genuinely cannot describe these people, and again, this has never, ever 
happened to me before! That is a cardinal sin for a movie so focused on 
pathos! So, fuck it; moving on!



If nothing else can be said, let it be known that this is a rather 
gorgeous film. CoMix Wave Films did an amazing job with the visuals and 
digital effects here, especially with the environment. Shoutouts to how 
jaw-dropping the comet was and how despite many shots being busy as 
hell, they all still look beautiful. Sure, the character designs are 
pretty bland and I don't enjoy the equally plain and sometimes malformed
 art style in general but it's all animated incredibly well for the most
 part. Sometimes it seems as if the characters are animated in CG with 
2D artwork put over them as the movements can feel almost uncanny every 
now and then, but rarely was it that distracting. There are some moments
 looked insanely choppy with blatantly low frame rates in comparison to 
everything else, though as per usual, this is apparently fixed in 
blu-rays and cinemas. Regardless, the film still looks amazing, even if 
the studio apparently ran out of budget for this film, and the fact that
 such a thing isn't noticeable at all is astounding, probably thanks to 
good cinematography and stellar digital effects.



RADWIMPS does several vocal tracks for the film's opening, ending, and 
background. None of them stick out, unfortunately, though that doesn't 
mean they're bad. In fact, after relistening to some of them, I find 
them mediocre at worst and decent at best. If there are any non-vocal 
background tracks, I don't remember them either. Ironic given what this 
film is about, which leads me to my final thoughts.



For a film about remembering, this film is awfully forgettable, 
especially in terms of its characters. As visually stunning as it is, I 
felt more annoyed than touched. This is easily the most forgettable film
 I've seen in quite some time, and it's not all that terrible but it's 
certainly not good in the slightest either from anything other than a 
visual perspective. Certainly not Number One anime film worthy, 
especially not when it's this contrived and unintentionally convoluted 
at time travel. I remember there was something about the director, 
Makoto Shinkai himself telling people to stop seeing this movie. He 
claimed that he didn't want people to see this as his magnum opus and 
for people to hold all of his films to that standard from now on, 
especially given the production issues that occurred towards the end. 
For me, I wouldn't know if this was his best film yet, but if so, then I
 dread his current filmography. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",4
111,Waffle_Empress,"Apparently, nowadays pretty visual effects are what makes a particular 
movie/series a masterpiece because Kimi no Na wa was probably one of the
 most ridiculous examples of what people tend to consider 'a stellar 
performance'.

I have to say, my relationship with Makoto Shinkai is strained at best. I
 had to drop his other film because I got tired of nothing but the 
visuals and horrible lack of solid plot or well-written characters. When
 you go to a restaurant for the first time and the service is poor, you 
will never go there ever again, even if you just didn't get lucky this 
one time, right?

          
        However, this particular film will be aired here soon. It's all 
over the place on MAL, as well as anime-related community pages in my 
country, and at some point I was ready to pay just to make it disappear.
 But then I decided to see what everyone was talking about.



Story: 4/10.

I wonder where I've seen that before. Oh right! The Lake House, 
Butterfly Effect and Freaky Friday! Yeah, that sounds about right, 
except the execution was poor, to say the least. Long story short, this 
is a story about two teenagers who suddenly start swapping bodies 
because... why? There is no explanation whatsoever. You will never know 
why it happened to them, what it had to do with Mitsuha, her family 
members and what it is for. The main characters hardly struggle, they 
don't get into funny or awkward situations, they just do the best they 
can and no one notices anything suspicious enough to send these two to 
the psycho ward this instant. No, people just accept and like these 
changes. Once again, take Freaky Friday for example. In that movie, 
swapping bodies was necessary to make the main two characters understand
 each other better. Kimi no Na wa never explains why Mitsuha began 
swapping bodies with Taki, why Taki was the chosen one and why they're 
destined to be together.

The plot twist is laughable. Assuming that most of you have already seen
 this film, allow me to go on without trying to avoid spoilers. All of a
 sudden, it turns out that Mitsuha died three years ago and Taki wants 
to save her. Now, tell me why Taki and Mitsuha never noticed that 
important detail. They use smartphones, they watch TV and see 
commercials and different shows, at the very least they must have 
calendars in their houses. In other words, this plot twists demonstrates
 that the main two characters are... not very bright, so to speak.

The plot is weak and full of details that come and go but are never 
explained. Makoto Shinkai has a serious problem as he tends to focus on 
the visual aspect of his work, completely ignoring crucial parts of the 
narrative.



Art: 9/10.

Art is stunning. The animation seemed a bit lazy and wacky at times, 
character designs were as simple as the genre requires, but overall, 
Makoto Shinkai is known for the art rather than stories. Sorry, but art 
is never enough to make a story good. It doesn't work that way.



Sound: 7/10.

Above average, indeed, but nothing outstanding. Sometimes music seemed out of place or was relatively forgettable.



Character: 1/10.

There are two main characters: Taki and Mitsuha. Taki is a typical boy, 
Mitsuha is a typical girl. One of them lives in Tokyo while the other 
'wants so much more than this provincial life'. Their personalities are 
painfully bland, characters have no clear goals and these two facts make
 it hard to actually care for Taki or Mitsuha. They're just there, 
they're the main characters, which is why they are on screen a lot. Body
 swapping does not bring out any new or special traits in them, it 
doesn't teach them anything, they do not learn anything, they simply 
exist.

1 out of 10 sounds like a rather harsh rating for the characters. 
However, keep in mind that there is absolutely nothing to the supporting
 cast while the two protagonists have little to no charisma or 
personality to care for and there is literally nothing to tell about 
them. Even by the end of the movie, I had no idea what kind of people 
they are.

Poor romance is another reason behind my low rating for this element of 
the story and the plot as a whole. Yes, they learn more about each 
other's lives. But, as a good friend of mine stated, being trapped 
inside another person's body will make one feel uncomfortable, which is 
why I cannot understand why Makoto Shinkai didn't pay more attention to 
the process of adaptation to this odd lifestyle. I do not believe in 
their love because they were controlling each other's bodies for a 
limited amount of time, falling in love with what they were creating 
rather than each other. Their so-called love was spontaneous and made 
zero sense story-wise as they did not seem to get to know each other 
well enough to actually love each other romantically.



Enjoyment: 3/10.

Aside from visual effects, that are more of a nice bonus rather than a 
necessity, I didn't find anything to look at. I may be wrong, but 
something's telling me that everyone would forget about this movie soon 
if it weren't for pretty visuals. Are art and animation really enough to
 get one's attention away from the plot holes or lack of logic?



Overall, I personally found this movie painfully overrated and overhyped
 while just as painfully average. While the idea wasn't unique already, 
the plot isn't fleshed out, which is why the film does not feel 
complete. People are starting to compare Shinkai to Miyazaki, but quite 
frankly, his current level is nowhere near that of Miyazaki or Ghibli.
        ",3
112,Angry_Anime_Nerd,"While I was watching this movie, I kept wondering what in the world I 
was watching. t was so complex and fast that I couldn't follow it. I 
just couldn't understand what was going on in this movie. A girl and a 
boy is constantly switching bodies and I couldn't tell if the girl was 
herself or if she was the boy in her body.



Now, I do not like complex, intense coming-of-age stories like this so I
 was worried I wouldn't like it but I decided to try it since a lot of 
people thought it was excellent but I didn't know it would be

          
        a coming-of-age story. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
 but I was still pretty disappointed. It was pretty iffy. It had a 
fairly interesting story because I like stories that focus on two 
characters with two different plots and I like the whole switching 
bodies thing but I just couldn't find myself relating to any of the 
characters. The characters can be rude and Mitsuha was also cloying. 
Taki was okay, but not great. I guess he was the only relatively 
interesting character out of this bunch.



The movie had too much crying in it. The only solid thing about this 
movie was the animation and the voice acting, they were pretty lovely. 
Most of the music sounded good. But the writing and the directing just 
wasn't my cup of tea.



I found this movie to be highly overrated and do not get why people praise this movie so highly.

Warning: This review may contain some spoilers.



I was so surprised when this movie reach the Top of MAL very quickly. I waited a few months to finally watch it.



The first half of the movie was a schoolar comedy about two teenagers 
than change bodies some days, we can appreciate the beautiful animation 
and the good music, also we can watch how is the Japanese life and the 
differences between the city and the countryside. The first half was 
very simple and funny. However, it had some errors, like the character's
 reaction were so unreal, also they don't try to communicate

          
        to each other, but we forgive it because at the beggining it wasn't serious.



Then the second half happens and the drama beggins. We know Shinkai is 
good at direction but such a bad writer. The story has A LOT of plot 
twist. Like the girl is from the past, but when she was in the future 
she couldn't see the date? Even if she was using the boy's phone? 
Ridiculous. Then we talk to each other even if they are in different 
years because the power of love. We never know how she saves the 
village. The boy doesn't remember the name of the village even if he was
 there for almost two weeks. Nad then. we have an open final like that 
we saw before wasn't that ridiculous. 



Concluding, ""Your Name"" was a bad movie, with such a bad writing and a 
great production values, but that doesn't make it deserve it's position 
of ""The Best anime of All time"", you can watch it if you want ""PRETTY 
COLORS"", but if you want a good story, it doesn't deserve your time. 
Such an Overrated movie



If you like it, I recommend you any Makoto Shinkai movie.",4
114,DrTelstra,"One word, overrated. When I first started to watch this movie, I was really interested in what they could do with such a fun plot device, but as the movie dragged out longer and longer I started to realise a major problem with the film. Our characters have no depth to them. You could sum up the entire movie into a single sentence.

ALTHOUGH! I did think that the soundtrack was beautiful and really got through to me, same goes with the art style. (especially the scene with the shooting stars).

The story is a bit off as well, I found myself questioning a lot of the plot points and really disliking the direction the movie was heading. The worst thing about the movie though has to be the ending, I will not spoil it, but if you watch this movie. Don't expect some sort of great conclusion like I did, because you will only have disappointment at the end.

Overall I will give it a 7 as the Art style and sound design save this movie from being a 5 or a 6.",7
115,Cold_Demage,"The story had so much potential and had me at the edge of my seat, and then just ripped me right out of the experience with a poorly placed song sequence that didn't fit the mood or flow of the scene. These songs made it feel like the movie was composed of short episodes with anime openings in between. This was my biggest issue with the movie. Other than that, the characters just felt like plot devices at times, having no consistency in the way they act and at times changing their entire personality at the drop of a hat. It felt like they were doing things because they had to do them in order to advance the story. There was no reasoning behind it, but you could tell what they would do because that was where the story was going.
Also, this one is a really small gripe but I hate the cliche of having a character act odd, then another character asks ""Who ARE you?"" as if nobody acts strange in real life. It's dumb and feels like an unnatural response every time I see it used.
Overall an enjoyable movie if you can look past everything I've said here, the animation is gorgeous and the story really is very good. For me the experience is just overshadowed by these small but numerous flaws. It really depends on what you value, personally I think the movie had potential which was ruined by the delivery.",6
116,screen_animu,"Well, as most of Makoto Shinkai's works, this anime had such potential. But, things got way too cheesy in some parts, though that was a very small issue. The character developments were good enough. The animation was fantastic. The only thing that bothered me is, the story is incomplete. They never told us how they connected with each other in the dreams, weather it was some genetic thing or something else, they just never told us. Well, it was romance, but it was of new kind, something we never saw before. So, I appreciate that part. But, as I mentioned before, they just cant leave the story incomplete. And people just ate it because it's ""romance"". Well, I get that.

So, quite a good movie. If you love ""school romantic anime"", it will be a worthwhile to watch it. But don't get too analytical and enjoy what it has to deliver.

Once again, it would had been a great anime if only it was ""complete"".

I hope you get some idea about it. Thank you for reading. Keep watching animuuuuuuu!!!!! :)",6
117,seekster,"At time of writing Kimi no Na Wa is the topped ranked anime on MyAnimeList and I cannot for the life of me understand why. Yes its good, I am not disputing that, but its certainly not a masterpiece in any way except maybe visually. I read some of the more recent reviews (after I wrote the other sections of this review) and found out that many people are starting to seem to calm down about the movie and look at it with more perspective (sort of like how people stopped freaking out about Frozen after several months...though to be fair Frozen did live up to its initial hype). Hopefully overtime the ratings on Kimi no Na Wa will come down into the low 9s or high 8s but as for myself I give it a 7 out of 10. On my list it has the same score as things like Fate/stay night, School Rumble, .hack//Sign, Ouran Host Club, and Suzumiya Haruhi.",7
118,Dokia,"I watched your name to see what the hype of the #1 anime movie was that was selling like hot cakes. I'm happy it wasn't a disappointment. Sure it wasn't amazing but it was a pretty decent movie. The story was pretty good with the body swapping but it got weird trying t o see if the story was going any where with that at all. Where the story went was very interesting with a plot twist that gives a big shock leaving you gripping your seat wondering how it'll turn out. Art wise CoMix Wave films studio lives up to their name of great background art and scenery not much to say. The soundtrack though i didn't pay too much attention too had moment when it hit you when it needed to at part that were growing in intensity or moments of surrealness. Though i wasn't a fan of the music video type moments that happen in CoMix Wave films studio where there is music playing and a bunch of scenery shots with no real purpose but passing the time. The characters were not all that special or interesting which made it obvious it was more of a story driven movie rather than character driven but seeing the difference between the characters when they swapped bodies was interesting none the less. Overall the movie was a 7/10. Nothing special but a decent movie none the less. Not something I would recommend as a movie to watch to someone but if they asked me if it was worth the watch i would say "" It was alright.""",7
119,FarrelSal,"Since this movie is currently sitting at the number 1 spot for all time 
top rated anime on this website, I assumed a large portion of you had 
already seen this movie, so this review will contain spoilers. 

Now that I got that out of the way, let’s just jump right into it.



Kimi no na wa is Makoto Shinkai’s latest movie, the story follows a guy 
named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha begins to switch bodies because, 
well, reasons. The first half of the movie is just your typical Slice of
 Life comedy that involves characters switching bodies. For the most 
part, it was

          
        harmless, until they tries to be something else in the second half.



The huge plot twist of this movie is that apparently Taki is not just 
switching bodies with mitsuha, but he’s apparently went 3 years back in 
time before Itomori (the village that mitsuha’s living in) got destroyed
 by a comet. 

Now now now, where do I even begin with all of this nonsense. So, 
apparently Taki was time travelling back in time the whole time yet, he 
didn’t realize that he was actually sent back to 3 years before the 
present? Hello? Am I the only one who noticed how stupid it was? 



How could Taki didn’t notice that he was time travelling back in time 
despite the fact that he was using mitsuha’s phone to write a diary? 
Uhm, I’m sorry but as far as I know every fucking phone in this entire 
goddamn planet tells you the current date and time AT THE TOP ON ITS 
FUCKING SCREEN, HOW DOES TAKI AND MITSUHA DIDN’T EVEN NOTICE THE 
SIMPLEST THING SUCH AS THAT?



Oh yeah I get it, because if they actually realized it right away the 
whole thing where Taki goes to meet mitsuha in person and found that she
 was actually dead long time ago wouldn’t be as dramatic as it would be 
if they didn’t realize it. Once again, anime is treating its viewers 
like some kind of retard, not so suprising eh? 



I don’t really mind about how they didn’t explain the whole body 
switching works. But to completely ignore logic just for the sake of 
being dramatic is beyond unforgivable. 



Well aside from the incoherent plot this movie excels at the 
presentation. Its really gorgeous and the colours are vivid. The show 
composition were great but that doesn’t hide the fact that the story was
 a complete mess.  If I'd to rate this movie solely because of the 
Presentation alone, it would be 8 or higher, sadly, the plot is a huge 
turn off for me that not even pretty colours could change my opinion 
about the movie.



As for the characters they’re completely forgettable and there’s nothing
 really stand out about them. The one thing that I don’t get is Taki and
 Mitsuha’s relationship. Just because you swapped bodies doesn’t mean 
that you have to fall in love with each other, their relationship has 
literally no chemistry whatsoever, even Taki and his coworker 
relationship makes more sense than him being with Mitsuha. 



There are more things to cover about this movie but I think this would be enough. 



In short, Kimi no na wa is far from what you can call a “Masterpiece”. 
But if you can ignore everything and just literally “turn your brain 
off” I can see why someone would like it. But as for me, I could not 
just overlook how stupid this movie is.",4
120,DeAeD,"Like most other people, I came here to watch Kimi no Na Wa primarily because is rated number 1 on myanimelist.



Having Watched Garden of Words, 5 Centimeters a Second, I could kind of 
guess that Kimi No Na Wa would be a film of similar caliber. By similar 
caliber, I mean astounding visuals but lacking in plot and character. 
Kimi no Na Wa follows this trend, but flops completely when it comes to 
story and character. 



Story 1/10



To be honest, I would give the story less than 1 if I could. Its not 
unexpected however, If you've watched similar movies such as Garden of 
Words

          
        and 5 Centimeters. However, Kimi no na Wa does exceptionally bad at the story. 



Although a general slice of life, romantic comedy is acceptable, Kimi no
 Na Wa attempted to try to become something it was not. Most notable is 
the beginning of the story, in which the characters swap bodies and 
affect each others lives. Although this part of the story is admittedly 
generic and not outstandingly creative, it does give the story a casual 
air to it, which also leads to some throwback humor as well. I admit 
that I personally was curious as to how severely the main characters 
could alter each others lives. However, the story goes in the wrong 
direction when it attempts to swing the entire story towards disaster.



If Kimi no Na Wa was simply a romantic comedy with some quirks and spins
 of its own, the story would be acceptable. However the story completely
 destroys what little it had by beginning to focus on the meteor falling
 apart, which leads to ideas such as amnesia, body swapping, death, and 
some ridiculous plot holes. 



Although no story is without flaw, Kimi no Na Wa fails to explain what 
is happening, and gives not the slightest clue as to why it is 
happening. After watching the movie, nobody knows why the main 
character's can't remember each other, why the male protagonist randomly
 decides to search for the girl, and why they swapped bodies. However 
that's not it.



The major sins of the story lie in the ridiculous concepts. The writers 
attempt to convince you that a child is able to first convince her 
friends that they are all going to die, and then proceeds to convince 
her father, the Mayor as well, who ultimately evacuates the entire town.
 It's hard to swallow that her friends could simply nod their heads and 
accept that they are going to die today, and its even more ridiculous 
how she was able to convince her father.

It only adds to my disappointment that the movie doesn't even show how she convinced her father, and simply cuts it out. 



I could write a book on Kimi no Na Wa's story, but lets just leave it at the most outstanding major flaws.



Character 1/10



Unless you are living under a rock and haven't watched at least 1 
descent movie, its clear that Kimi no Na Wa fails when it comes to 
characters.



The character themselves are bland, boring, and most importantly, have 
ideals, goals and ideas that the watcher simply cannot understand. 



There's no clear indicator as to why the characters fall in love, and 
what they like about each other. However their unrealistic motives only 
add to their already boring characteristics.



And let me just say that boring characters are at times, okay. When it 
comes to casual shows or a simple slice of life, one can expect a 
character to be somewhat bland. However as a show that tries to make a 
huge impact, Kimi no Na Wa's characters jump from stagnant to super 
heroes, which gives the viewer no room for connection as the characters 
seem to act as puppets whose only purposes are to allow for the story to
 develop.



In general, the characters begin as generic and boring, and ended off as unrealistic and even more bland than before.



Art 10/10



However not all is lost, as Kimi no Na Wa shines in its vivid animation 
and golden scenery. This is to be expected by the producing studio, and 
it does not disappoint.



Sound 8/10



This is to be expected for any movie.



Enjoyment 3/10



I hate to rate enjoyment, as I was slightly interested in the beginning 
but quickly lost all interest as the story progressed. The arts good, so
 I wont give it a 1/10.



Overall 1/10



My general advice to you is to watch the movie and critique it by 
yourself first, without the input of others. However if you are reading 
this review, then I'm preaching to the wrong people. If you truly love 
this movie, then there is not much I can do for you. However I would not
 recommend this movie to anyone, as there are so many better movies out 
there begging to be watched. Go watch a Gibly film and do yourself a 
favor.

121,DirtyDill,"I found myself itching to skip ahead as I couldn’t take a single moment more of anticipation as if every second was an absolute eternity (call back to time). I stifled this desire and patiently watched on. There are many people who give this a 10/10 which I can understand from the objective, but in terms of my subjective opinion this cannot be hailed as a masterpiece. I feel the writing was too lackadaisical, and the character development which I put great importance on was greatly lacking. I think much of the inflated scores by people are due to the fact that much of anime is completely visually appealing with cheap characters and plots, so when a story comes out with some actual semblance of those things it’s a shock to the equilibrium and seems vastly greater then what it is.
In conclusion, I would say I would highly recommend it just for the experience; all though for me it didn’t leave any lasting emotional impact or much surprise as most events could be foreseen. But it did do a good job of keeping me watching and wanting more even though I had a good idea of what was to come. Ultimately, if you go in with the expectations of your typical anime, you will come out reborn to the potential of real story writing and animation, with a soundtrack you will have on repeat for weeks.",8
122,Splair,"Let me be honest here, Kimi no Na wa has an amazing story and high production value. If you're looking for a pretty movie, stop reading this review and just watch it.

However, in terms of plot this anime fell flat- because this exact plot twist has already been done! It wasn't even a shock for me, but it must have been for others if this anime is so highly rated. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but Kimi no Na wa has the exact same plot twist that is shown in the anime Zetsuen no Tempest. Also compared with the fact that this anime is a movie about a boy and girl that don't interact very much if at all, so there is a decreased level of emotional investment despite the melancholic scenes later on, compared to Zetsuen no Tempest which actually has some interaction between the characters and explored this plot twist in depth.

Overall, I had a lot of fun while watching this and it's definitely not bad, just has a bit of lost potential by rehashing something done before.",8
123,bolubee,"As is expected of a Makoto Shinkai movie, Kimi no nawa was a masterpiece. A ""hybrid"" masterpiece I dare to say. It has a blend of Kotonoha no Niwa's visual prowess and 5 centimeters per seconds ability to create a melancholy atmosphere.

The soundtrack was amazing and the character development was solid. The only imperfection in the otherwise perfect movie was the storyline, a minute problem which I would attribute to the movie's length's inability to contain plot that would have portrayed a solid reason for the characters to bond as they did.

In the end, kimi no nawa is a movie I wouldn't mind recommending to a friend or watching a couple of more times.

All things put into consideration, the movie is a 10/10",10
124,hinto,"*Reading this review will make you notice bad things about the movie. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't read this.



Your Name is like that one SpongeBob episode where he's wearing 
inflatable muscles that look impressive, but when he tries to actually 
lift weights his arms pop off his shoulders. Your Name looks great 
visually, but as far as plot goes, its arms pop off.



It's also a good-hearted Film with wonderful art. 

If you're looking to zone out to something on a rainy Sunday afternoon 
and can easily emotionally connect with movies, Your Name may be a good 
pick. It has some really great

          
        background art to take in, a few funny scenes, and has sincerity to it.



However, I did score this a 4/10. Being fairly boring aside, its main 
problem is that it does not make sense. Its leaps of logic took me out 
of the movie, including: confusing scene order, a peabrained ""romance"" 
storyline, and contradictory/unexplained plot devices. Makoto Shinkai is
 clearly skilled in art and cinematography, but here, the storytelling 
is not very much that. I feel like the movie rides on its charm and 
visuals, hoping that's enough for you to not notice its poor writing. To
 be fair, the strategy worked for most of its audience.



The characters are likable (I liked Mitsuha the most), but you don't get
 to know them well. Not enough for them to be of much impact. My 
favorite stories are character-driven, and this isn't. But Miyazaki 
characters are the same way, yet those movies are pretty good. I did 
feel a tinge of emotion for these characters, but I hardly knew them and
 their story wasn't told well, so it wasn't much.



I can see why people like Your Name, it has its moments and is visually 
outstanding. Most people like the movie, maybe you do as well. Maybe 
I'll like it more someday when I'm less critical, since I did like parts
 of it. 



Still, the more I think about the movie, the more I believe that its 
plot was only  about 70% properly finished. What it tried to deliver 
needed another 45 minutes of character and plot development, because 
much of it makes no sense and feels cut off from itself, like an 
incomplete sentence. Maybe Shinkai knows this more than anyone and ran 
out of time by a large measure.



A good-spirited movie with fantastic visuals, enjoyable humor, and a disjointed narrative. 



Might I add this: when you encounter someone who dislikes something 
popular that you enjoyed yourself, you can see them as someone to resent
 and oppose, or you can see them as someone who wasn't allowed to enjoy 
something everyone else did. A boat you may be in sooner or later.



TL;DR: Your Lame XD",4
125,MaryamAutumnGold,"A disappointment. Shinkai has never failed to not impress me. With 
characters as flat as cardboard and a story that could have been 
mastered by a five year old, Your name has positive ratings and that 
fact has baffled me to no end. I shall now proceed with my review, but I
 advise you to be cautious as my thoughts might offend you greatly. 





Story: 



An absolutely wonderful story (sarcasm) filled with so many plotholes 
and contradictions you might feel your head burst, not to mention the 
constant avoidance of explaining even the most bizarre occurances, 
leaving many to just say, ""Well, it's magic!"" Where

          
        shall I begin?



1) A huge meteorite is going past earth. A chunk of it breaks and 
hurtles towards Earth. If one takes basic science into consideration, 
this comet ought to have disintegrated upon entering the Earth's 
atmosphere, but it didn't and the movie left us cursing the japanese 
government merely because of the fact that it wont take a genius to at 
least be AWARE of a giant meteorite that can't be burned down (We're in 
the twenty first century. Are you implying that you have no sorts of 
telescopes to at least observe a comets size and determine whether it's 
gonna burn up or not?) can be a huge threat. Apparently, this comet can 
cause a body switching to occur. We have no explanation to why this 
happens, it's just because of magic.



2. Two people switch bodies with eachother and have not at least 
attempted to check their surroundings (Because body switching is not 
suspicious.) They continue disrupting eachothers lives while ignoring 
the possibilities and danger, as shown by the mere fact the boy does not
 even know where the girl lives for fucks sake (He needed to use his 
scetches to determine where she lived). No one tries to bother checking 
the year and none of them even notice the year by newspapers, articles, 
calenders or even fucking cellphones.



3. After the timetravel happens, we have a brief flash of Mitsuha 
remembering the comet that hit her. We have no explanation as to why she
 remembered all of a sudden but it just happened. Magic! ! ! 



4. How can Taki and Mitsuha not even remember their names after they've 
met eachother before twilight? (the part where Mitsuha has to evacuate 
everybody and has gone to the ruins to find Taki.) I posted this on 
reddit a few hours ago and many comments refuted me and claimed that 
they were in a dreamlike state (I have realised never to share opinions 
on reddit, but that's another story.) However, we can clearly see that 
Taki has a perfect and detailed memory of Itomori, as shown in his 
drawings. Was remembering Mitsuha's name such a difficulty for him? Why?
 And why did he forget it on that exact moment? 



5) When Mitsuha goes to the train at 2013, why hadn't she noticed the 
fact that Taki was younger? Considering that both had vivid memories (as
 displayed by Taki's art), why can't she at least not see that he's 
different? She was able to find him familiar at the end of the movie, 
despite having nearly all of her memories about him lost (She could not 
even remember his fucking name). For someone her age it would not be a 
huge feat to realise that something is wrong with her boyfriend. 
Speaking of boyfriends....





Characters 



So far the only things I can say about Mitsuha and Taki is that Taki is 
boyish and full of anger (I needed to know this by the waitress' 
remarks) while Mitsuha is girly and cares for everyone. You might argue 
that the movie had a limited screentime but that theory was refuted many
 times as displayed by Disney's Lion King, Mulan, Frozen and Miyazaki's 
Howl Moving castle (Though the only characters who I thought deserved 
the title of well round and interesting was the Witch and Calcifer.) The
 romance between them is quite forced as shown by the mere fact that 
none of them even know where they live. A body switching is not 
sufficient enough to cause such a deep attraction, and while the 
attraction would be understandable if both characters had amazing 
qualities that would make anyone love them, having a normal and boring 
past is not going to do much.





Animation



The art style was wonderful. The animation? Not so much. It starts of 
smooth and compelling and ends up so rigid in a matter of seconds that 
one would feel cheated just by looking at it. I appreciate the part 
where Mitsuha's mother is looking at her newborn but other than that not
 a single moment deserved a shoutout. The animation was average at best.





Music:



The music was not that great either. A generic soudtrack to be honest. I
 found it quite annoying that they placed a song in several crucial 
moments, like when Mitsuha is trying to evacuate everyone and a generic 
love songs pops up. Your character is on the verge of dying and the fate
 of everyone is in her hands, everyone in the movie theater is holding 
their breaths, what do you do? Pop a singer here.







Atmosphere



The moments between Taki and Mitsuha were awkward, and a bunch of 
unnecessary moments were stuffed in here and there. An example could 
include the part where Taki in Mitsuha's body is racing towards the 
cliff and the camera shows the back view of Mitsuha's skin as the skirt 
flies up and down. Not the best moment when you're trying to save 
everyone. Not to mention the sudden tantrum Taki had just because he 
forgot Mitsuha's name, or Mitsuha falling down while running towards her
 father's office (Note, this is the part where the meteorite is hurtling
 toward Earth) only to stare at her hand and sob as she forgets Takis 
name. I was extremely pissed when they build a lot of suspense for the 
final confrontation between Mitsuha and her father only to cut it off 
and forget about it.





Enjoyment:



It's quite a feat for such a simple movie to crush people's attention 
and cause such misconception. The explanation of what is going on is 
tossed here and there, leaving the viewer confused and baffled. It might
 be due to the contradiction, as shown above (Having vivid memories at 
one moment but then forgetting names at the other) or merely the 
language barrier but nevertheless I was not compelled to rewatch this 
monstrosity. I would have rated this movie a bit lower had I not been 
entertained for the 20 minutes after the first hour but the ending made 
me check my watch due to how slow it was. Speaking of slow, the movie 
has a habit of dragging on and on and when something does happen it 
feels so rushed one can bearly make out what they're saying. 



A 4/10



I shall now end this review with the generic statement almost every 
other reviewer has used once in their lifetime: Do not watch this. 
        ",4
126,V4mpyr,"I try keep my reviews short & sweet without spoilers. This is for anyone on the fence as to whether or not to watch this show. So the question you're probably asking is; is this show worth my time? The answer being; fans of the romance, drama and/or great animation will definitely find their time well spent on this anime. Below I will expand on my thoughts as to why I believe so.

Story & Character (7)

""Why am I crying?""

Taki & Mitsuha questioned themselves. A mutual feeling I often asked myself during the show as well. The genius that is Makota Shinkai is brought to the table once again, and in a collaboration of amazing art, sound & story we are lead on a roller coaster ride of emotions. I felt movies always suffered through a lack of character development, or were too short for us to actually feel a connection with its characters, but Kimi No Na Wa proves me wrong.

I felt the story, though generic in the whole body swap freaky friday occurrence, there is a slight twist in the fact nobody remembers what they did in the body they've swapped into. Which leads to a few awkward yet hilarious moments as well as the characters figuring out how to eventually communicate with each other upon swapping, I felt this was well paced and not rushed. Kimi No Na Wa does well to realize it is a movie with limited time, and doesn't shift its focus off Taki or Mitsuha, though additional characters are introduced, Kimi No Na Wa doesn't try to do too much and make a mess of things. Something I've often witnessed in movies without a series.

One thing I really want to mention is if you ever felt frustrated with a male MC not taking the reins, or being too shy to do anything to the babes you see in every anime you tend to watch. Do not fear, because Taki does everything any young man would do upon swapping into a woman's body. I salute him and his teenage hormones.

Art & Sound (9)

I will touch on this only briefly, as I believe the animation in this was unreal. I watched it on Blu-Ray and paid for it on amazon. It would definitely be something I'd show someone who was trying to get into anime just to showcase how eye-catching anime can be when done right. As for sounds, I felt the voice acting was great and felt it was never out of place nor cheesy. One thing I cannot stand is forced lines or characters just saying each others names over and over again while cueing the dramatic music. That does just not do it for me, I'm glad Kimi No Na Wa doesn't take this route but instead draws on the relativity of how we instead are always looking for someone, someone we feel who is out there, we are fated to meet, but just haven't met yet. Feelings of hope to eventually meet this person and the emptiness of still being alone intertwined into one big roller coaster ride which feels purposely crafted by Shinkai Makoto to tug on the heart strings of the audience who might've once felt the pain of lost love.

Overall (8) -

Overall, an enjoyable experience I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre. Even if you aren't I would still say give this movie a shot. Tip-Top animation complimented by great voice acting and music, the heartwarming story of Kimi No na Wa will have you laughing in your seat and without revealing too much possibly shedding a tear at the frustration of how sometimes communication gets lost or confused, and we never get to really say the things we want to say. So we just need to take that step back and ask the questions which are important. I loved this movie and hope you will too. Thanks for reading.",8
127,cocolita22,"This movie was seriously spectacular! I will never forget it. The characters, music, plot and overall art is incredibly memorable. I was also extremely emotional the entire time, so there's that.

I think this movie is a must-watch in anime. Regardless how you feel about romance, this is not the stereotypical romantic anime, and actually has mystery components to it. From the very beginning, you will be intrigued and curious about what's going on since the movie just starts off right into the action without immediate explanation. As a result, you'll be hooked!

The art is really something else. It's stunning! The music was beautiful too. Overall, the entire movie is so enjoyable and I can't express enough how much I love it!! Definitely something you will want to rewatch for years to come and show all your friends! They'll be sure to cry and love it no matter how they feel about anime.",10
128,Alex_Jaro,"Kimi no na wa is a romantic shojo movie but certain changes, outstanding music, art, characters, and plot make it unique.

First things first, Art? The animation and artstyle are both crisp and soft on the eyes. Smooth animation and beautiful graphics, for sure a 10/10.

Music? From what I noticed there were 4 different songs and some osts written for this anime. Fun thing is that I knew them all from rhythm games and games of all sorts, I would say each and every was a 10 or at least 9/10, goosebump-giving melodies and voice acting along with beautiful lyrics that match the movie. 10/10 for music

So what about the story, I will keep this part strictly unspoiled (except for the very basic things), for example, the story starts with two teenagers that change bodies when they dream/sleep. This is a great and genius way of bringing together two totally random people and putting each one on each others' shoes. They also learn to know and learn how each other feels. The director also uses several other unoriginal but amazing techniques to improve how this work of art makes you feel. Just because the story includes some pretty unoriginal techniques and it is pretty predictable at times, I have to give the story a 7/10. I like this body-swapping thing and other things but it lacks some romance.

The characters are fine, I will surely not forget about them, they also are pretty unique, interesting, and relatable, just original, good-looking, and realistic in general. I would say they deserve an 8/10.

As for my enjoyment, just like I said earlier I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I can tell why people absolutely loved and die for this anime. It is really unique, smart, well done, and crisp. 100% one you *must* watch. So..rating? Well, I would give it an 8, it was enjoyable, well done and had some great music in it, the manga is pretty much what this anime was but without the great sound and animation, It just lacked some more romance, aced most categories but the story was a little weaker. 8/10, very good.",8
129,ArcOof,"The movie was on par with Hayao Miyazaki’s movies. I think that’s the greatest compliment one can ever get.

Spoiler Alert

The movie is surreal. The story may sound like a fantasy but you’ll be amazed by how Makoto Shinkai makes it feel like a real life event. Even the places are mostly real world locations.

Begins with a slow start and a cliché idea of a boy and girl randomly switching bodies. Gradually both become used to it and start appreciating and enjoying each others lives and then the swapping suddenly stops! Then there are some events a bit sad ones and interesting ones and an ending that leaves you bewitched with a feeling you can’t explain with mere words.

All these plus some hilarious moments and few sad moments with the best Animation and perfect soundtrack makes the movie even better. I think it’s a must watch for everyone, doesn’t matter if you watch Anime or not. You’ll be Amazed.",9
130,Zhuwx1,"Kimi no na wa is another one of those anime where my friends all suggest me to watch it, but I delayed it for a while. This is just another wakeup call to watch good anime sooner. Kimi no na wa is a beautiful story that has a very interesting plot twist, and has some of the best art I have seen.

Story- The story is touching and is simply fantastic. Because I really do not want to spoil the show for anyone, I cannot discuss some plot points that were really good. The basic show premise is that two people, a boy and a girl, switch bodies at random, and have to live out each others life. One has to deal with the busy city life, and the other has to deal with the boring rural life. The plot will get more complicated than that don't worry.

Art- The art on this movie is the best art I have seen in any animation I have ever watched. It was so realistic at some points, and also very surreal at others. Regardless, it takes you to Japan and shows you the wonders of nature.

Sound- The music and sound effects were also top notch. The sound effects of nature really remind me of nature and the music is also very relaxing to listen to.

Characters- The characters in this show are very good. Most of them are funny, caring, but with some character flaws. They remind me of real people that can exist and are characters I want to be friends with. There are some characters that are reduced to a very flat role, but the other strong characters make up for it.

Enjoyment- The show's twists and turns allow me to be engaged and connected throughout the duration of the movie. Not only that, but it kept me wanting more.

Overall- If you haven't watched this anime, what are you doing? Grab some snacks and enjoy a beautiful movie.",10
131,Bensonas,"Massively surprised by this original, and very beautiful film

Some friends of mine are currently taking it in turns selecting a film to watch. My previous turn was Redline, which was quite frankly, putting the animation to one side, garbage. This type of film is one that wouldn't be my first choice. Mainly because I'm a simple man, i want action and stunning animation, but mainly action. Classically, this film is in 3 simple parts, beginning, middle and end. With this in mind, my review below will follow the same vein.

The Beginning
From the moment Your Name starts, you are immediately drawn in to the story. It paces the start to the story so perfectly that you want to focus on its progress rather than having to over think trying to follow whats going on. It becomes obvious very quickly what is happening, and the character development really shines in such a short period of time, as the two main character become more familiar with each other circumstances, you can sense a subtle affection growing that is charming. Yet even though their relationship develops, Your Name does a wonderful job of not progressing two quickly.

The Middle
This is where our first big reveal comes and its delivered perfectly. The story pacing up to this point is perfect and it continues as such. The twist in the plot really hits you. This is where you find out how much you have invested in the characters without even realising. The supporting characters play a very important role here and add just enough to the story to not be frustrating like some supporting characters are in other anime, but rather really likable. And so the fantastic writing continues....

The End
Honestly.....i cried OK!, not at the very end, but there is one moment that builds to the perfect climax you simply cannot help but let the tears go. Looking at it simply, its been done many many times in films, its just the way it was delivered that was so perfect. Absolutely stunning writing.
As we near towards the end you feel it drawing to a close, not in a rushed way, in the exact same way the entire story has been told, brilliantly. Once we do get to the conclusion, you are perfectly happy, not overwhelmed with emotion, frustrated, devastated etc, just happy, and that is exactly how it should have been.

Oh...animation is stunning too!",9
132,jamesveerman,"Your Name is one of those special movies that comes around every few years. This film is one of the most beautiful and profound pieces of cinema i've ever watched. Every single one of the characters I fell in love with and I feel that relative to each ones screen time and importance to the story we got to know well. The art and animation in this movie is miles above almost anything else i've ever seen. I'm an emotional person and that means I cry in a lot of movies/shows, but this one hit especially hard and I had tears in my eyes almost all the way through the movie and for the last 30 or so minutes I was just sobbing at how beautiful and emotional the movie was. I believe that even if one is not into romance anime or movies in general there is still a good chance that they will enjoy this movie. This movie is also a good anime film to show to people who don't watch anime. One of my favorite anime of all time and around my 5th favorite Movie of all time. This anime deserves nothing less then a 10/10.",10
133,mattblamey,"An absolutely stunning masterpiece.
Anime won't feel that same after watching this.

Makoto Shinkai didn't miss with this one. In my opinion, his best work. I've seen Weathering with You, but I believe this one is more interesting and enjoyable.

Sound:
The music by RADWIMPS is wonderful. The songs slap, they go from upbeat and hype songs, to more emotional songs. They fit this movie perfectly. If you watch this movie, the songs are probably one of the most memorable bits of this whole experience. They go hand in hand with the visuals, and make the movie so great.

Character:
The characters in the movie are loveable and relatable. Taki, a regular teenage boy living in Tokyo. Many of the people watching can relate to him. And Mitsuha, a girl living in the Japanese countryside, not content with her lifestyle and wishes to move to Tokyo. These characters don't bring the movie down. I have noticed a trend among many animes, where if a character is unlikeable, it makes the show harder to watch. This is not the case. The characters work with the shows aesthetic and are written into the show perfectly. Shinkai did well.

Enjoyment:
I greatly enjoyed this film. Many say it is sad, but it is just very emotional.",10
134,Kuro38,"i was surprised when i watched this anime. It's likely...the HE version of anime 5m/s. And I firgured out it was witten by Shinkai Makoto, it was amazing. It has many things as same as the anime 5cm/s has, you can see some familiar backgrounds, blossoms drop, the comet, the childhood's love....Two characters are far from each others, two times the boy turns back, but only once the girl reply to it :(
So, that is truly what i want. If you love someone, pls try your best to come to her. No matter how painful it is, 'cause we only live once..",10
135,Norakoo,"First things first, calling this movie is an understatement. This movie would be 11/10 if there was that option. This is no joke one of the best anime movies I have seen. HELL! I just made a MAL account just so I could review this gem of a movie. This stunning film is Makoto Shinkai’s best film yet, and that's saying A LOT.
It took me on a rollercoaster of feels and tears. The plot, the sound, the art, the characters and the cinematography, they all took my breath away. I had a myriad of feelings from every aspect of this film. I highly recommend just forgetting reading reviews if you haven’t seen it, as this gold deserves not to be spoiled. However, since you are here, I'm going to write one and make sure you damn see it. Don’t worry~ it's spoiler free ;)

Art: Charming. From just the opening sequences my heart jumped in excitement. The colour Makoto Shinkai brings to his films are unlike any other. You can see how much work went into every aspect of this film, but especially the art. The scenery was mind-blowingly artistic and beautiful, creating a beautiful esthetic. Crisp and utterly beautiful. I especially loved how the scenery and art were used. The cinematography at points was like a drug to me. Such beautiful animation should be illegal.
BTW: For those who have seen a lot of anime of similar genre, the art may look very familiar. The character designer was Takana Masayoshi also known for the design of AnoHana and Ano Natsu De Matteru. Indeed this only just added to the charm (and also the feelz).

Characters: Somehow Makoto Shinkai made these beautiful loving characters through what seemed to be very little scene time. By about 30 min in I already LOVED the characters and their qualities. Sure, I would have loved to see more but within a movie like this a director doesn’t usually have that much connection time to establish such colourful characters within such a complex plot. Yet Makoto Shinkai managed to do it (claps). Movies like this usually have such rushed character development and I was really worried coming into this movie that this movie would fall under such category, however, this movie delivered way more than asked.

Plot: I really don’t want to spoil this. Seriously. But what seems to be quite a simple premise is just SO MUCH MORE. Adding to the gold, the plot and story are just magnificent. New and original, quite unpredictable, the plot grabs you and takes you. Literally takes you on a journey. Reading the synopsis you may think that this is a typical romance movie with a slight twist. It really isn’t! its romance but it doesn’t have the sort of cliché you are thinking of. I love seeing such original content such as this, really warms my heart.

Sound: I feel that a lot of people may not 100% enjoy this aspect of the movie as it actually played quite a large role. However saying that I'm not one of those people. For me, it added to the feels and the enjoyment of the film. It was seriously beautiful and fit perfectly with the aesthetic of the film. There were points within the film where I was like “oh okay… music” as it was quite abrupt however overall it added to the film.

Overall this movie takes the cake. All the cake. From every aspect, it was just beautiful. Sure you might think this is going to be a typical rom-com however it really isn’t. I full heartedly say: watch this movie! From day one, after seeing the trailers and poster art, I knew this movie was going to be gold (and it was). Freaking beautiful.",10
136,Pipe,"For many years a have thought that Spirited Away was the best anime film ever made. We had waited 16 years to change our mind and now I am able to say that Your name (君の名は) is now the best anime film to date, even if this year didn't receive an Anne or an Oscar.

The story argument is simple and clear. Sometimes the simplest story creates a narrative that will entertain all the persons for a couple hours.

For some sort of the destiny, two persons (Take and Mitsuha) are bound with the lace of the fate and time, they will find themselves in their dreams and in their life, they change their soul and heart and share experiences that will create a bond that at the end will change the past, present, and future. That's the simple argument captured in this film. These changes affect the space and time, they switch their bodies, and from time to time they start to love each other, and if they forget their names the wheel of the time will reunite them one more time. Story 8/10

To create these bonds, it was needed to share an outstanding art. This film has a clever use of lighting, combined with very detailed landscapes that immerse the watcher in the story waiting for a development that takes some time.

About the sound, it is good. The songs and the whole OST is great and combines the simplicity of the story and the quality of the art creating a film that will stay with us for a long time.

Finally, the character development isn't the strong part of the film. We need to understand that is a film adapted from a graphic novel for these reasons, maybe some characters aren't that complex as they should be. The story doesn't require a complex character development so adding more complexity and background to the characters would have affected the final narrative.

In summary, you should watch it to have two hours of enjoyment and to see a great narrative in action. Now we need to wait other 16 years to see a anime film that could be better than this one.",9
137,Lilith_Letrange,"This was one of the good ones I've watched. Nevertheless, the only unexpected twist was in the moment when Taki realized that what he saw happened 3 years ago. Also the time-line twist is fairly original mixed with switching bodies and the addition of religion was somewhat interesting (not my taste but fairly interesting).
Characters development was somewhat disregarded and other then being body-switching individuals - the main characters had no personality traits that stand out.
I gave it overall ate because even if the topic of the story was not very original, it was actually interesting to watch and the whole story wasn't monotone and it felt like it has 4 stages:
1. Everyday life and body-switching
2. Meteor disaster
3. Realization and going back in time
4. Present time where they both meet at the same point in time-line
I find this to be very good story development with very little or none loop holes in the story.",8
138,Dingaling,"Imagine yourself in a dream as another person without knowing it was reality that allows you to do the things you always dreamed of by using another’s life but later to draw affection towards one another. This was the plot line of Kimi no na wa (Your Name). Not much words come to mind when describing a movie like this. It is simply stunning. This movie will trigger many of your emotions from happy to sad. As we follow the main characters, Taki and Mitsuha in an amusing adventure as they are able to switch bodies through sleep and get to know about each other’s friends, family and their lives. It seemed at the beginning it was all fun and games, the mentality as if you were in a dream. However, the story started to escalate after the two knew it was more than just a dream, it was reality. After time passed the two main characters drew feeling for one another and promised to write a note on their next switch. The switch never happened. They weren’t able to confess to one another and at that time on, as every second passes a little more of what you recall is lost, just like a dream. The reason why they were not able to switch bodies anymore is for you to find out. This movie presents the struggle to see, save, remember and be with the one you truly care for one last time.
",10
139,StockingReview,"The story isn't anything special but the execution of it was good mainly because of how great the character design is. The characters are normal and don't really have anything super crazy so when they start to understand their feelings despite the fictional tone of it it's still pretty easy to relate and feel the same feelings that the main characters are feeling in those scenes.

I think the romance could have been done better Makoto Shinkai has this strange obsession with waiting until the end for the relationship to develop into something more which is kind of a double edged sword for him. On one end the impact of the development is much stronger on the other hand there isn't much time left in the movie for the viewer to experience the two characters as a couple rather than two people who kinda like eachother. I think he pulled it off better in this film than he does in other films but I still felt pretty unsatisfied with how it turned out and it's definitely something I hope he does differently in the future although I doubt it.

But the main draw to this movie is undoubtedly the animation. Which is absolutely stunning and probably his best so far. The colors change depending on the mood as well as the style of cinematography. When the scene is supposed to be happy and lighthearted there are lots of fast cuts and when it's supposed to be more emotional and sad it will stay on one camera angle for longer periods of time to make it more impactful. Which is nothing super special but I think a lot of animators get lazy with that kind of thing nowadays and I figured it was worth mentioning.

Overall I think this movie is worth watching it's my favorite Makoto Shinkai film so far and will probably make my top list for 2016. I'm going to give it an 8/10.

TLDR - Stunning art, meh romance, good characters and character design.",8
140,iAquaphoria,"Story: IMHO, it was very good. I wished it wasn't centered on supernatural, but overall, I think it's a great movie with a subtle incorporation of romance. I believe that the plot is very straightforward, and that it won't leave you scratching your head. It wasn't the most brilliant (at least the ending wasn't as romantic as I hoped) but it's Makoto Shinkai we are talking about here, famous for 5 cm/s. As always, the ending is up to your interpretation, but unforunately, happy romantic endings and Makoto Shinkai do not go hand in hand. ALL I WANTED WAS 1 KISS SCENE AT THE END, AND I COULD REST IN PEACE.

Art: I mostly watch anime that are realistic. 5 cm/s, Oregairu, Tari Tari, Hyouka, to name a few. I think that it's a lovely depiction of life with the artwork. Hands down, no flying characters and any kicks that send a character flying ten miles. The colors of the comet were also a major bonus in my eyes.

Sound: I usually don't grade much on sound, but Zen Zen Zense by RADWIMPS was simply amazing. When I heard it first in the trailer, that was the main reason for drawing me in. Trailers are usually amazing but a lot don't accurately depict the movie excitement, but you won't be disappointed by Kimi no Na Wa.

Characters: Pretty typical high school characters. Taki is your average day high schooler studying architecture and has a part time job, and Mitsuha is a girl living in a small town raised with traditional practices. Kind of rushed in the description of the characters, but I think they were very simple and to the point with both of them. Developed, but could use a tad bit more IMO.

Enjoyment: Hmm. Once more, I enjoyed it a large extent. I hate ambiguous endings (although this one implies that it's a happy one), I prefer anime that have at least a romance ending. Perhaps it's because I dislike melancholic things, even something like Fruits of Grisaia had an upbeat ending, despite behind psychological-themed. I JUST WANTED A ROMANTIC ENDING, but it's Shinkai running the show. I didn't find out until after I watched it, I was very certain it mirrored 5 cm/s at the end so I had a hunch.

Overall: Definitely would recommend to anybody. If you hate ambiguous endings like me and would bang your head against the wall if you don't get the ending you want, I'd advise caution. I'm glad I saw it, but I'll be melancholic since the anime ended on a amorphous note.",8
141,Icanpostnow,"You know this movie has masterpiece level art. That is probably why many of you can't wait for this movie to come out in other countries. I just saw this in a Japanese movie theater yesterday. This was the 5th weekend that the movie has been out and the theater was still packed. I was lucky enough to see this movie on a giant screen with an impeccable sound system. Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie in the best-quality environment possible.

The good: Long story short, Makoto Shinkai deserves a lot of praise. For me personally, the best part of this movie was the moments in which he depicted what it feels like to be in Tokyo for the first time as a young person. There are other movies that show Tokyo's dark side, but the enthralling joy he portrayed in this movie is also a very real feeling. The way the four Radwimps songs, including the ending credit song, were incorporated was also masterpiece level. It felt like AMVs on steroids and did not take away from the flow of the movie in my opinion. It was a choice the director made and I loved it.

The not as good: Just writing ""the plot"" seems like a cop-out but I don't want to write spoilers. I had a hard time finding an important message the director and creators wanted to convey. For me, themes are very important in a movie. I like having a theme that teaches me something about the world or new perspective. I had a harder time finding this on my own. I'll be scouring the internet to see what others noticed and I didn't. Also I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than the second half of the movie. However, the second half is still interesting and does provide a few ""that's cool"" moments.",8
142,canyouread,"k, so this is my first review up on MAL, but I think this movie deserves my first.

Makoto Shinkai, you've done it again. A work of beauty and marvellous storytelling. I won't summarise it since almost everyone else has, and plus, there's a synopsis for a reason. I will say, though, that the plot, though initially I thought was pretty generic, twisted its way right to my heart. How Shinkai transformed a seemingly bland story into a heart-wrenching movie that kept me on the edge of my seat was extraordinary. Given, Shinkai has extraordinary talent himself, producing titles like ""The Garden of Words"" and ""5 Centimetres per Second"", both on my all-time favourites list, so it's not exactly unexpected that he created this masterpiece.",10
143,TheHeckle,"Kimi no Na Wa.
Another masterpiece, done by Makoto Shinkai.
This is my first ever review I've ever done so go easy on me :3, and also it's my first ever anime I've rated a masterpiece or 10/10

This anime movie had many aspects that were 'perfect'. The background music done by RADWIMPS were well done and the ost's that they have produced are top of the anime ost lists. People may believe this anime was over hyped but I believed that a beautiful anime like this wasn't hyped enough. If you're interested in the states and how well this anime has done, this anime made roughly 1.3 billion yen on the first day of the movie coming out.
The story line that was developed was fairly complicated compared to many other romance animes that are out there, The techniques that were used very professionally like for example 'time travel'.
One of the most impressive things about this movie was the visuals, most animes aren't able to afford such animation like Kimi no Na Wa so we are blessed to view such animation. Unfourtnletly I don't live in Japan so I'm not able to view the quality that I wished to and I missed a few amazing 'mise en scenes' due to the lack of quality that I had. Never less I still did view the anime in the quality '720p' which is still amazing.
The plot was unpredictable, at the start, i thought I was able to predict most of the anime but I was wrong, I should have expected Makoto Shinkai to throw a few curve balls at us.
Well, that concludes my review I understand that I missed many important and essential details about the movie, but in the end, if you still haven't watched it yet I highly recommend watching the film",10
144,9spaceking,"Story: 6/10
Kimi No Nawa has a very interesting story. It pulls us in with the plot of a girl and boy switching bodies, basically doing activities in each others' lives, and later adds in a time-traveling ""mini-twist"" to this. It is presented in a very nice way, however, it does have logical flaws: what exactly caused the switch? Why do the characters suddenly get amnesia? These questions caused me to be confused, and partially ruin the story. Nevertheless, the fact that the girl-boy relationship is developed well, in addition to a finally happy ending (remember, this guy usually doesn't have those), satisfy any fan of Makoto Shinkai.

Art: 10/10
Makoto Shinkai's art is always excellent. The animation is spot on, absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The trailer showcases the best moments, but even over 1 hour and 45 minutes, this art is consistent, and I have no complaints about it.

Sound: 10/10
The music was fitting and beautiful, each scene tinkling with great accompaniment. Not only so, the characters (more on this later) were quite realistic with good voices that stressed their personalities, especially after the boy and the girl switched bodies. I must applaud the director for excellently manipulating the voices to apply for their situation.

Character: 7/10
Despite the fact that the story, art, and sound are all excellent, the character is where Makoto falls short. He has very limited time to introduce any characters other than our main two, so we don't really know any other character. In addition, even these two characters are difficult to truly pin down. We get that Taki is hard-working, yet can't resist womanly charms ;) (if you know what I mean). We get that Mitsuha is very appealing and nice. Yet it doesn't get too much further than that. There are some moments here and there, but overall I feel like the two aren't too in-depth portrayed. This is sacrificed for the love story, which I feel is okay, but they spend too much time on their recovering from amnesia to really focus on a more human personality.

Enjoyment: 8/10
I really enjoyed this movie, and some scenes (especially the comet scene) practically moved me to tears. Still, I did mention that the time-travel scheme did confuse me, and the fact that it was never explained confused me and dwindled down my interest in the film.
_________________________________________________________
SUMMARY/OVERALL (no spoilers): 8/10
With excellent characters, motivating story, beautiful art, and a finally happy ending, Kimi No Nawa is no doubt a great anime, with the sole flaw being the crucial main plot devices never delved too deeply in detail, leaving some viewers with no doubt scratching their heads in confusion, but nevertheless enjoying the other parts of the movie.",8
145,Darumyro,"Kimi no Na wa was a film in which I had a curious experience. I watched it on 3 occasions: the first time in 2017, a second time in 2019 for better understanding of the plot and the third time in 2020 for final conclusions. This review considers the three times for analysis.

- STORY - Being an anime under the direction of Makoto Shinkai, is expected to have some elements and narrative resources that are characteristic of the director himself. Talking about this film, it can be said that it is a work of detail, I would say that watching with the appropriate attention, from 60% - 70% is possible to understand without difficulty. The rest of the plot, interpretation, explanations about events that happen, and actions of the protagonists are left to the viewer's interpretation. This makes many people think: the story is disconnected or even meaningless. But it is still a quality of the film: nothing is so explicit, leaving the work with a certain value of rewatch to those who are interested in the clues that are shown along the movie. In the end, the anime does not deliver the full storyline, it requires some theorizing to be a complete story.

- ART - Accounting only for the basis of a 2D work: animation, design (visual and consistency) and scenarios, carries part of the fame. In the year that this review is being written, Kimi no Na wa premiered 4 years ago, and remains a work of visual art, with fluid movements, designs that highlight its characters, and scenarios made in 2D of singular beauty, maintaining its title as one of the most beautiful animes ever made. About the visual effects, nothing to add to what has already been said, they are vivid, and together with the lighting techniques used, they put the work in focus whenever the subject “best anime special effects” is brought up in conversation.

- SOUND - Sound, just for the tracks used in the film, is already worthy of note 10. Not only for the songs alone but considering what they manage to transmit in a spontaneous emotional way, with the meaning of the lyrics. When put together with the scene constructions, without ignoring the excellence of the original voice acting, it makes this criterion the apex of the film.

- CHARACTERS - Characters, in Kimi no Na wa, in addition to the two protagonists, there is great involvement of good supporting characters, playing important roles throughout the plot. It is not a work about a couple that solves all the problems that appear in the story. The whole process of introducing, developing and finalizing many characters that appear is done in a convincing way. Every character plays a role, bringing interactions to life, but excluding the protagonists, there is no other memorable character, which ends up damaging the score of this criterion.

- FINISHING - Overall, the final score is 8. After reading all the explanations above, it is easy to conclude that the film is good. But I say: the exaggerated hype that is made about it ends up harming the experience for some people, and this was my case. I am not considering my personal disappointment as a criterion, but as part of my experience with the film, so this is the reason that it prevents a higher score.",8
146,bronosh,"I have a rule to never rate anything below 5 and never over 9. But this movie is one of the exceptions to the rule.

There is nothing to complain about it, it's very enjoyable, doesn't rely heavily on plot twist to keep you engaged, the characters are not overdeveloped, and we dont linger on side-plots neither.

Story: It's a short story with a lovable cast and a great, yet predictable, plot.

Ary: The animation is lovely, make yourself a favor and watch it on 1080p +. I was watching it on a browser at 720 and the quality was average, but it kept buffering, so i got it on Bluray instead and watch it for a second time and boy let me tell you, it's basically a different movie.

Sound: The song's lyrics were fitting for each moment, the background music never felt too much or louder than the voice of the characters, and it has some lovely soundtrack, nothing to complain about.

Character: The cast i lovable, a bit one dimensional, as each one fulfilled just one roll, our main characters on the other hand are perfectly developed for the story, i could like to see more of them in different interaction, but i dont we have enough time to fully developed them in a movie.

Enjoyment: Rewatched it right after finishing it, nuf said.

Overall: I'm a bit of a cynical, that enjoys a bit darker anime, yet i enjoyed this one. It marks all the boxes for a good movie and then it builds into something beautiful, not many movies can deliver in such short run time.",10
147,kira-is-armin,"Being one of the greatest anime movies, it has no flaws.
Many people will say otherwise but let me explain.

(I will only review about the story and characters as the art and sound are brilliant). There are no major spoilers but skip my review if you want not even a little spoiler.

Story:

You might have heard that sometimes it becomes predictable or it has many plot holes due to the concept of mushibi but it really does not matter. This is a 1hr 35min movie so to want an explanation of mushibi is just trying to point out flaws that aren't there. Let's take the example of Gintama, have you ever seen the explanation of why the aliens are superior? what happened to the world outside? To apply common sense in it is illogical and you can't ask the explanation of mushibi because no one knows (the great fire of mayugoro).
Let's come to the main point, the story is pretty complicated and confusing that is why you may have heard people not giving it appreciation. If you miss one line you will not be able to understand what is going on.
On being predictable, it happens just one to two times and is really nothing.

Characters:

For some reason people want character-building in a one and a half our movie but your name has that. Take Mitsuha and you will see that before the incident (no spoilers) we see her enjoying the life that she's been given. She enjoys the festival and has no problems on living in Itomori (reason for haircut). So, she has some character development and that concludes it for the main characters (Taki also has it, watch the movie once again; im not ging to point out everything).
The side characters do not have much screen time (they are not making naruto here) but they feel like they are alive. Okudera who you'll think as a pretty-does-everything-right character has her own share of not doing everything right. The characters are very well written and are not robots doing everything for the mains and they have their own personalities.

Your name has brilliant storyline and brilliant characters but if you will not pay attention and miss one single line you will not understand anything. The concept of mushibi is understandable as it is a village lore which nobody knows about that much and is true so you won't get any explanation, it is the best anime movie and don't take my word for it, watch it and you will understand (dont forget to pay attention).",10
148,Ragio,"It probably involves beauty around it.

This is it; Kimi No Na Wa(Your name) comes an important part of what made the year 2016 excelent for anime with the likes of MHA, Re-Zero,Mob Psycho and of course the greatest ever, KOE NO KATACHI. Its been 4 years since its release but i wish it would be availible at the movies or to be 2016 again; with its scenery and music combined, it would probably be one of the best times in my life.



The story is confusing. Given its about one girl and one guy switching bodies all the time and one begins to act like the other and suddenly they are the same back again made me wonder if i was delusional or the movie was that difficult to get. But continuning the movie, one thing stood out. Him finding her, her finding him; the writting on the hands..""Im always looking for something.""



In reality, this movie is all about love. When you think about love, its mostly wonders which is what the movie is trying to tell; it bonds people. The never ending feeling that you´re missing something.


Besides its wonderful story, the scenery is literally pornography. Everywhere you look, theres care into it. Vibrant colors, shots from every angle...Tokyo specially, looks very VERY detailed; i can´t imagine how much time these guys spent just drawing all those shots, its amazing and i congratulate them.



Art and story are the formula for a spectacular movie. This movie will certinally mark generations to come. It doesn´t have such a deep story as koe no katachi for example but it certinally holds up on its own.

149,RyanSpring,"Break out the pitchforks and torches and send the angry mob to my house- I'm just going to come out and say right from the get go that this movie is- gulp- overrated. For those already triggered and offended, take a step back and realize that overrated is not the same as bad. I do not, by any means, think this is a bad film. I gave it an 8, which is a very good score. I just don't see this as an absolute slam dunk 10 out of 10 top 10 anime of all time masterpiece the way a large portion of the community seems to. Let's get into it.

Art-

This anime is visually beautiful and extremely well animated. I have no qualms whatsoever with its visual presentation and there were absolutely a handful of shots where one could just pause the show, take in the beautiful scenery and just appreciate it from a purely artistically beautiful point of view. In my opinion the art and visual presentation is the overall strongest point of the show.

Sound-

The voice acting was pretty good but did not blow me away. No one had a performance that truly stood out to me as outstanding and sometimes Taki's voice in the dub seemed a bit off to me. Passable all around, but nothing special.

The soundtrack also didn't stand out to me as particularly mind blowing. Similar to the voice acting it was pretty good, no egregiously bad songs and each piece was individually GOOD, but nothing really went beyond GOOD to me. I was looking for that one EXCELLENT, blow me away, this is THE track of this anime kind of song and it just never came. This soundtrack, while perfectly respectable and pleasant, wouldn't come remotely close to my personal top 50 anime soundtracks of all time list.

Character/Story-

This is probably where my opinion varies the most from that of the general community and where people will be most upset and offended, but I really think the story is significantly overrated. I liked the base premise of the body switching, connected fates, caring about someone so much as to traverse time to keep them alive and stop a tragic disaster, etc. It's an intriguing concept that hasn't been done a million times before and it had a lot of potential.

The execution, however, felt very average to me. First and foremost, a story like this is supposed to be based around love and emotions and in order to be effective it has to really hit the viewer in the feels. For me it just didn't. I didn't find myself fighting back tears or feel my stomach really twisting at any point during this anime. I was cheering for both of the main characters for sure, but it just didn't have the emotional impact on me the way other anime such as Erased, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia and From The New World have in the past.

Additionally, I felt the story was rather shallow. I feel they could have gone further with it and done more with the concept. To me it lacked depth and there was some wasted potential in not taking a concept with all the potential in the world a bit further.

Finally, there were definitely some logic holes and conveniences that really detracted from my enjoyment. When in the original timeline 500 ish people died it is not realistic that in the new timeline, even with all the efforts of the characters to warn people and minimize the casualties of the disaster, that there would be 0 deaths. That's just way too happy happy and convenient and unrealistic. Realistically there would always be at least a handful of people who either did not get the warning (sleeping, in the shower, whatever) or simply chose not to heed the warning through either not believing it or just being lazy. The notion that all 500 people who otherwise would have been killed ALL heard and obeyed the warning and ALL went to the school on time is nonsensical and significantly detracted from the emotional impact of the story for me. I would have been much happier if the death count went from 500 to 75, which is much more believable, as opposed to from 500 to 0. Come on man...

Enjoyment-

I liked the movie, loved its visuals and generally appreciated what was, as a blanket statement, a high quality piece of art. BUT, all that said, I simply was not blown away. An all time very good to be sure, and worthy of being mentioned in discussions, but wildly overrated as an all time top 10. As of this writing it's ranked number 3 on this site and I could never, ever agree with that.

Overall-

A solid ride worth taking with a great concept and gorgeous visuals. The emotional impact is overstated and it's not nearly as deep as other anime out there, but it's still a good movie, albeit not an amazing one, that I'd recommend. Just get off the ""best anime ever"" hype train- that's too far.",8
150,Halofan1997,"Your Name is deservedly and widely considered to be one of the greatest anime films ever created! Despite it's obvious flaws, the shows strengths more than make up for the issues and elevate it above the rest of it's competition. I don't believe there is a single romance anime out there that can compete with this movie. I've seen romance anime before, and honestly, I don't like the vast majority of them. But this is the one romance anime that I not only enjoy, but believe is legitimately great!

I sat my mother down to watch this movie. She hates pretty much all anime (and I don't blame her), but she didn't just love Your Name. it ended up being one of her favorite movies of all time!

So, as surprising as this must be, Your Name gets the highest possible score of 10/10! (* shock, Gasp. So unheard of!) It is a masterpiece: a must-see for anyone, even if you don't like anime or romance. If you haven't already seen this movie, I would highly recommend you at least give this movie a try one time. You may think it's overrated at the end, but I'd be surprised if you didn't at least think it was good.",10
